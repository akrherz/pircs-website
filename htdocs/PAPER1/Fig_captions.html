<P>FIGURES</P>

<P>1.  Simulation domain of PIRCS Experiment 1for the 60-km polar-stereographic projection.   The &quot;+&quot; symbols mark every other gridpoint of every other latitude.</P>

<P>2.  Time-average 500 hPa height field for 15 May - 15 July 1988 from the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis.</P>

<P>3.  Time-average root-mean-square deviation (RMSD; left) and bias (right)  of model predicted 500 hPa heights compared with the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis:  (a) HIRHAM; (b) Scripps RSM; (c) NCEP RSM; (d) DARLAM; (e) HIRHAM; (f) NCEP RSM; (g) MM5-BATS.</P>

<P>4.  Time series of spatially averaged RMSD of 500 hPa heights.</P>

<P>5.  Standard deviation of 500 hPa heights for 15 May - 15 July 1988 as observed in the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis.</P>

<P>6.  Time series of precipitation averaged over a portion of the upper Mississippi River basin (37-47 N; 89-99 W).</P>

<P>7.  Time-average diurnal cycles of surface latent heat flux, sensible heat flux and incident shortwave radiation from FIFE observations processed by Betts and Ball (1998) and from each model&#146;s gridpoint nearest the FIFE site.</P>

<P>8.  Time series of surface latent heat flux from each model&#146;s gridpoint nearest the FIFE site.  FIFE curves are each time&#146;s average over all observing instruments plus or minus the standard deviation among instruments.  Models are identified in the key for each panel.  All curves have been subjected to a 5-day running average.</P>

<P>9.  Like Fig. 8, but for surface sensible heat flux.</P>

<P>10.  Like Fig. 8, but for incident solar radiation.</P>

<P>11. Time series of daily maximum temperature from FIFE observations processed by Betts and Ball (1998) and from each model&#146;s gridpoint nearest the FIFE site.</P>

<P>12.  Like Fig. 11, but for daily minimum temperature</P>
