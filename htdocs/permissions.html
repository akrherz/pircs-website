Datasets</font></center><p>

<font class="text">
Data submitted for each PIRCS experiment initially will be reserved for a period not to 
exceed six (6) months so that participants in the project (including all who submit data)
 may create an article for a peer reviewed publication summarizing the results of the 
 intercomparsion.  After submittal to the journal of this first paper on each experiment,
  the data will be made available to users outside the PIRCS authors community upon 
  submission of a statement of how the data will be used. The ISU PIRCS team will prepare 
  documentation describing the dataset size and structure so that potential users will 
  understand the characteristics of the dataset.  Any statement of use by users of raw datasets 
  will be publicly posted on the PIRCS website.  Intercomparison participants will be notified 
  of requests before data are sent out.  In order to acknowledge contributions of individual
   modeling groups who have provided the requested data, potential users will be provided 
   draft wording of a citation and a list of basic publications describing the models that 
   should be referenced by users. These <a href="proj1aparts.html">basic publications</a> will be supplied as an updated 
   file on the PIRCS website.<p>
