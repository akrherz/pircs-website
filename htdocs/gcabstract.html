    <BR><p>We present preliminary results of regional climate models
    participating in the Project to Intercompare Regional
    Climate Simulations (PIRCS). The goal of PIRCS is to advance
    the state of regional climate modeling by a series of
    systematic intercomparisons. PIRCS Experiment 1 is devoted to
    two sharply contrasting hydrologic regimes, namely the
    drought of 1988 and the regional flood of 1993 in the central
    U.S. Here we discuss preliminary results for Experiment 1a,
    which is devoted to the 1988 drought.</p>
    <p>The simulation domain covers the continental U.S. and
    adjacent regions with an outer buffer region in which
    large-scale forcing is imposed. When forced by boundary
    conditions from the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis all models are able
    to recover the patterns of mean 500 mb height over the
    simulation domain. The standard deviation of the 500 mb
    heights, which reflects synoptic-scale storm tracks, also is
    well reproduced.</p>
    <p>Analysis of predicted precipitation focuses on a portion
    of the Upper Mississippi River basin that is well resolved
    from the standpoint of a regional model (of order 400 grid
    points) but poorly resolved in terms of a GCM or the
    NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis. Comparison to observed precipitation
    indicates that the models generally are able to replicate wet
    and dry periods in the observations, though amounts may
    be underpredicted or overpredicted. All models capture
    the lateral boundary forcing as indicated by the timing of
    specific precipitation episodes. Departures
    from the observed precipitation trend increased somewhat
    toward the end of the period and may point to the
    implications of soil moisture feedbacks. Although the
    nocturnal maximum in precipitation over the central U.S. is
    not as pronounced as is observed, the models represent the
    nocturnal maximum substantially better than the
    NCEP/NCAR reanalysis. </p>
    <p>These results indicate that while details of the predictions
    differ from model to model, regional climate models in
    general are able to reproduce observed dynamical fields and
    timing of precipitation episodes when provided with
    appropriate observed forcing at their lateral boundaries.</p>
