Overview of IITAP/EES given by Dr. Gene Takle during the visit of Dr. 
Federico Mayor, Director-General of UNESCO, to the Intercomparison 
Workshop, November 17, 1994</font>
</CENTER><HR>
<P><font class="text">
Dr. Mayor, I would like you to meet Dr. Richard Anthes, President of 
the <A HREF="http://home.ucar.edu/ucar.html">University Corporation for 
Atmospheric Research</A> and Keynote speaker for our workshop. In 
addition to his duties as administrator of UCAR, Dr. Anthes is widely 
recognized as the dean of regional scale atmospheric modeling. </P>
<P>
This workshop is one of a number of activities planned for <A
 HREF="http://www.iitap.iastate.edu/ees/home.html">IITAP's Thrust Area 
in Environmental and Earth Sciences,</A> and it is typical of the 
activities we envision for this area of IITAP, because it offers an 
opportunity to apply basic physical science principles to the study of 
environmental problems that are common to both developed and developing 
countries. </P>
<P>
We feel that the environmental sciences offer unique opportunities for 
IITAP to promote science infrastructure in developing countries. Access 
to clean air, safe drinking water, and an adequate supply of nutritious 
food are goals of both developed and developing countries. 
Environmental modeling, of the kind practiced by scientists in this 
room, offers tools for local policy makers to choose the more 
sustainable options for achieving these goals during the process of 
economic development. </P>
<P>
A second reason for pursuing the environmental sciences under IITAP is 
that each country has unique climatic, geological, geographical, and 
biopheric characteristics that are of interest to scientists outside as 
well as inside these countries. By bringing his or her unique 
environmental datasets, scientists from the developing countries come 
as equal partners to the international collaboration and thereby will 
be motivated to retain ties to their native lands and sources of data. </P>
<P>
We have assembled in this room representatives of a cross-section of 
the major regional climate modeling research groups in the world. Our 
purpose is to design a model intercomparison project that will help us 
evaluate these models and produce new ones. We have some scientists 
from developing countries at this meeting, and it is our intent to 
engage many more such people when the project is underway so that they 
can learn the modeling process by active participation. </P>
<P>
The models used by many people in this room are more computationally 
demanding than even global climate models. This fact has limited their 
operational platforms to supercomputers - that is,until very recently. 
Powerful computer workstations now can be used for these simulations, 
which potentially makes these models accessible to scientists from 
developing countries. As computing power continues to advance, these 
developing-country partners will become even more actively engaged in 
climate modeling.</P>
<P>
Discussions I have had with some of our workshop participants indicates 
to me that the IITAP motivation to engage scientists from developing 
countries into our project adds urgency and incentive to what we do. We 
look forward to working with each other, with scientists from 
developing countries, and with <A HREF="http://www.unesco.org/">UNESCO</A>
 as our project gets underway. </P>
<P>
We thank you for visiting our workshop, and we would like to help 
answer any questions you may have about our work.</P></font>
