	Atmospheric mesoscale models are useful tools for studying and
forecasting the behavior of the atmosphere over several days.  In recent
years, scientists have begun applying these models to regional climate
(continental scale or smaller) in simulations lasting several weeks to
several months. These models can simulate climate for a region at
resolutions higher than global models are likely to attain routinely in the
foreseeable future.  This feature makes them desirable tools for providing
output on regional climate variability that can be used for climate impact
assessment, because natural and human impacts of climate change are
typically felt on the regional scales.  Mesoscale models are thus
complementary tools to global climate models.<p>
	There are several challenges, however, posed by using mesoscale
model output to assess regional climate-change impacts.  Satisfying all of
these challenges will require increased communication between mesoscale
climate-modelers and impacts assessors.  We categorize this communication
into three modes of interaction.  Rapid improvement of regional
climate-change assessments will require concurrent activity in all three
modes.<p>
	In Mode One, the physical climate simulated by a mesoscale model
provides input into impact assessment models such as agricultural,
water-resources or human-health models.  This is the most direct and
immediate use of mesoscale climate simulation.  Numerous examples exist of
Mode One assessments using global models, which can guide mesoscale-model
applications.  However, a number of issues still need to be resolved, which
can be summarized in part by a series of questions:
<ul>
<li>What mesoscale model output must be archived for impacts assessment?
<li>How frequently should the model simulation be sampled?
<li>What cumulative output must be archived?
<li>What are the error estimates for the model output?
<li>How much do these errors contaminate the impact assessments?
<li>Are there assessments that can not be done at the current
state-of-the-science modeling?
<li>Should known biases in model output be adjusted, even though this
may upset the physical consistency of the output?
</ul>
<p>
	These issues involve challenges to both the modelers and the impact
assessors.  Modelers will likely have to expand the list of output they
routinely archive, which increases data storage requirements and
potentially slows model integration through increased I/O.  Modelers may
also have to build additional diagnostic codes into their models.  Impact
assessors will need to determine how sensitive their assessment codes are
to errors in the input data derived from climate models.<p>
	In Mode Two , mesoscale modelers add new computations to their
model that are not fundamental to its simulation of climate, but desirable
for impact assessment.  Mode Two is a continuation of an ongoing trend
wherein climate models have progressively internalized more and more
earth-system processes.  Recent examples include simplified representations
of soil and ecosystem dynamics.  These processes may be used in Mode One in
external, post-processing modules driven by mesoscale-model output, whereas
in the second mode, they are coupled directly into the simulation.
Important questions for Mode Two include
<ul>
<li>What are the next candidates for internalization?
<li>Are there specific input needs for a process module that are best
satisfied by direct coupling?
<li>What new, potentially significant feedbacks are introduced?
<li>What are the impediments to direct coupling of a process?
<li>What is the computational burden of internalizing a process?  Does
internalizing allow one to obtain an impact assessment more
efficiently?
<li>What other costs and advantages are there to direct coupling?
</ul>
	This mode requires articulation by impacts assessors of what
impact-assessment models are capable of coupling directly into a mesoscale
model.  It also requires modelers to articulate their simulation
capabilities, such as what fields are routinely computed within the model
even if not saved in output archives.<p>
	In Mode Three, impact assessors upgrade their models in response to
new types of driving data from mesoscale models that are not regularly
available from observations.  For example, many agricultural models use
degree-days or daily minimum and maximum temperatures as input, partly
because that information is recorded and archived.  However, plant
development involves temperature-sensitive processes during both day and
night.  Routine observations of temperature fluctuations during the diurnal
cycle are not often available at mesoscale resolution, but a model can
provide them almost on a minute-by-minute scale.  Relevant questions for
Mode Three include
<ul>
<li>What is the potential for improving impacts assessment models (when
given more comprehensive information about the physical environment)?
<li>Are there clear research paths for producing timely improvements?
<li>What is gained?
<li>What additional demands do such improvements make on mesoscale models
	and model archives?
</ul>
	Mode Three can be viewed in part as a step that must be taken for a
process before internalizing it in a model.  However, it also poses a
challenge to impact assessors that routine observations do not.  It
requires them to determine more carefully the sensitivity of their target
processes to temporal fluctuations and whether or not their modeling could
be improved with input data of much higher frequency or of a different type
than routinely observed.
