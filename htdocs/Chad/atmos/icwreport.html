<a name="welcome"><b>Welcoming Remarks by Dr. Takle</b></a><p>
The group was welcomed on behalf of IITAP, Iowa State University, and
the Department of Geological and Atmospheric Sciences by Dr. Gene Takle,
IITAP Thrust Area Coordinator for Environmental and Earth Sciences
(EES).  He  outlined the general goals of IITAP including the application
of science (physics) to environmental (meteorological) problems, and the
training of developing countries' scientists. He then gave the mission
statement of the EES of IITAP which is:
<pre>
     <i>To address basic and applied problems</i> in environmental
and earth sciences by use of basic physical science 
principles, and to use this mechanism for creating and
expanding partnerships with scientists from developing 
countries to enhance local science infrastructure.
</pre>
<p>
Dr. Takle noted that there are many environmental problems that are
shared by both developed and developing countries where cooperation could help
solve these problems.  Also he noted that there are many unique
databases in developing countries that local scientists have
access to and that could be shared with scientists in developed
countries.  An institution like IITAP could help train scientists as
they analyze these databases.  The importance of trained
scientists in providing local solutions to environmental problems
and to provide guidance to local policymakers in their decision making, was also mentioned.
<p>
Takle then noted that in the above context the initial
thrust activities of the earth and
environmental sciences division would be regional-scale climate
modeling, studies in shelterbelt
turbulence, and the development of an electronic classroom.  The
main goal of the regional-
climate modeling effort would be to improve the status of
regional-scale meteorological models
and to promote their use by developing countries for solving
environmental problems.  It was
also made clear that the proposed activities were not intended to
be performed exclusively by
or at Iowa State.
<p>
           Takle then noted that the main mission of the workshop
was to design a first experiment
for the proposed regional-climate model intercomparison.  Dr.
Martin Jischke (President of Iowa
State and UCAR trustee) was then introduced to the workshop.  He
made a few general
welcoming remarks and gave a brief historical background about the
origins of IITAP.  He also 
noted that this was the first technical workshop to be hosted by
IITAP.  Jischke then introduced
the Keynote speaker Dr. Richard Anthes (Director of NCAR/UCAR).
<p>


<a name="keynote"><b>Keynote address by Dr. Richard Anthes</b><p>

           Anthes started off by noting that climate is much more
than 30 year averages of monthly
mean temperatures and precipitation.  It also includes a
description of the frequency and intensity
of extreme events such as hurricanes, droughts, floods,
thunderstorms, and prolonged hot and
cold spells.  He also noted that climate includes a description of
the temporal and spatial
variability of climate variables.  In short; climate is the
integral over time of the weather, and
in order to know the integral (climate) we have to know how the
integrand (weather) behaves.<p>

           Anthes then presented a schematic of the components that
are represented in 3-D climate
models.  He noted that the large-scale factors that determine the
earth's climate (the radiation
balance and the rotation of the earth) are included in 1-D and 2-D
climate models that are
adequate for describing the gross features of the earth's climate. 
The 3-D global models do a
good job describing the large-scale spatial and temporal structure
of the climate, but their coarse
resolution is not adequate for describing climate on scales finer
than a few hundred kilometers. 
Since information about climate is needed at these scales,
motivation is provided for regional-
scale climate modeling.<p>

           He then gave some hypotheses that form the basis for
regional climate modeling, which
were:
<ul>
<li>           a) the climate at a point is determined by interactions
between large-scale atmospheric
              circulations and mesoscale  physical processes.  This
interaction is 2-way, but
<li>       b) down-scale interaction is most important;
<li>           c) mesoscale processes are determined by i) internal
instabilities in the large-scale flow
              and ii) mesoscale variations in terrain and land-use;
<li>           d) if the large-scale is known then mesoscale models can
improve significantly the       
 prediction of climate, since they can represent these
instabilities and finer-scale                 
  variations.
</ul><p>
           He concluded that if GCMs predict the large-scale well
then mesoscale models may be
embedded via a 1-way interaction to add mesoscale detail to
regional climates.  However, a
cautionary note was added that if the GCM does not do well at the
large-scale, then the
mesoscale model will produce a poor or useless simulation.
<p>
           Anthes then showed some results from western U.S.
January climate simulations with
MM4 (60 km grid) embedded in an R-15 GCM (Giorgi and Bates,
(1989)). The results showed
the refinements in the structure of precipitation that were
possible using the mesoscale model. 
He also showed some recent work of Sousounis and Fritsch (1994)
regarding the aggregate
influence of the Great Lakes on that region's climate.  Their
modeling work showed that the
Great Lakes tend to modify the large-scale flow by producing a
regional low near the surface
("a lake-aggregate circulation") and an anticyclonic circulation
near 700 mb.<p>

           Anthes then demonstrated the ability of mesoscale models
to capture extreme events such
as a rapidly intensifying Atlantic cyclone by showing video of MM5
simulations of the January
4, 1989 ERICA IOP 4 storm (Reed et al. (1994)).  The video was very
interesting and it
included a demonstration of the sensitivity of the model
simulations of the storms intensity and
life-cycle to the inclusion of friction, horizontal diffusion and
surface physical processes.<p>

<a name="potter"><b>Global climate model intercomparison; AMIP
experience</b><p>

                     The next speaker was Jerry Potter from
Lawrence Livermore who shared with the
workshop the Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and
Intercomparison (PCMDI) experiences
with the Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP).  The
purpose of AMIP is to
document model performance under realistic conditions, facilitate
model diagnosis and
validation, and provide a benchmark for sensitivity studies.  The
first experiment that was
conducted to help achieve the three goals was a simulation of the
global climate between 1979-
1988 with prescribed monthly mean SST's, sea ice, CO2, and the
solar constant.  Potter noted
that this was basically an "El Nino" experiment since the
overwhelming climate signal
(perturbation) in that period was the El Nino of 1982-1983.  He
also stated that they were
planning to extend the simulations 6 more years through 1994. 
After the simulations were done
by the groups involved (30 major climate modeling groups in the
world) an in-depth analysis was
to be performed via diagnostic sub-projects.  Part of the AMIP
experience was that many of the
initial simulations had to be redone because many of the variables
required by the subprojects
had not been saved, or had been saved too infrequently.  He
stressed the importance of careful
planning in deciding what variables should be saved and at what
frequency ("Save as much as
you can!" was the catch cry).<p>

           Potter noted that Lawrence Livermore had offered
computer time to some of the
modeling groups involved and that the need for ensemble runs had
placed constraints on the
resolution at which the models could be run.  He also noted that
50% of their staff time (20
scientist/computer technicians) was devoted to AMIP, and as an
example he stated the case of
one of their staff who had spent a year documenting all the models
involved in the experiment
(T.J. Phillips, (1994)).  Potter noted the support that the DOE and
WGNE/WCRP had given
AMIP.<p>

           The most important aspect of AMIP has been the
identification of systematic errors
amongst the models.  As an example Potter noted that diagnosis of
the tropics revealed
anomalously low short-wave radiation absorption in all the model
atmospheres.<p>

           The data structure had to be self-describing for
atmospheric modeling use, and they had
to design an interface between the database (of model results) and
a diagnostic library which
included visualization tools capable of handling various formats
(netCDF, GRIB, HDF, DPS,
and GraDS).  They also have a Mosaic home-page
(URL http://www-pcmdi.llnl.gov/) where
people will be able to extract data to
their site or perform some calculations with some variables at data
central.  He noted that
consistency among models as to units used and levels at which
output was available should be
agreed upon, or procedures to handle differences should be sorted
out before any simulations
are done.  Storage limitations and data access could also be a
problem (model histories- 6 hr
state of model = 100 GB per run).  They have a facility for mass
storage with a capacity of 20
Terabytes of storage at data central which is needed to handle the
data efficiently.  The analyses
used for validation of the simulations will come from NMC, NASA,
NRL, and ECMWF
analyses. 
<p>

           A list of some of the subprojects was then given.  They
could basically be divided into
3 categories involving the study of processes such as cloud
radiative forcing, regional climates,
and phenomena such as blocking.  The support of these sub-projects
was one of the tasks
assigned to AMIP management.  Other tasks assigned were
communication with the groups
(newsletters), quality control of the analyses and model output,
and the organization of
conferences and workshops.  The importance of quality control of
the model output and the need
for it to be converted to standard format could not be understated. 
Finally, he noted that it was 
important this intercomparison was not meant to be a "beauty contest"
among the models.
A reference for the AMIP project was given as Gates, (1992).<p>

<a name="chouinard"><b>Mesoscale forecast model intercomparison; COMPARE experience</b></a><p>
           The next speaker was Clement Chouinard of the Canadian
Atmospheric Environment
Service group that organized the first case of the Comparison Of Mesoscale
Prediction And Research 
Experiments (COMPARE) project, which was designed to compare the
performance of
mesoscale models in forecasting synoptic events such as maritime
cyclogenesis.  The objectives
of COMPARE are to "propose and perform experiments in a
collaborative manner to further
understanding and predictive capability at the mesoscale", to
"identify important issues of
mesoscale research and prediction that may be addressed by
numerical experimentation", and
"to establish a testbed of representative mesoscale cases using raw
data, assimilation systems and
analyses of the highest possible quality".<p>

           The following scientific issues at the mesoscale have been
identified:
<ul>
<li>           a) assessment of mesoscale forecast quality, and the
identification of common strengths
              and weaknesses of the models and any systematic
errors at the regional scale;

<li>           b) clarification of the importance of the influence of
LBC's on forecast quality;

<li>           c) evaluation of mesoscale predictability in terms of
LBC specification, data density and 
              assimilation methods, synoptic situation and the
specification of LBC's;

<li>           d) classification of impact of model characteristics,
such as horizontal and vertical    
              resolution, numerical methods, physical
parameterizations etc. on forecast quality; and

<li>           e) identification of any components missing from existing
models.
</ul>
           Chouinard then described the set of standard procedures and
methodology for producing the analyses that would be used to drive the
models.  A minimum frequency of 6 hours was to be used for the data 
assimilation cycle.  Analyses were to be provided for at least the 24 hour 
period up to the initial forecast time.
The analyzed data were to be
formatted on 2 regular lat/lon grids, the first being on a 1 degree
global grid, the 2nd being "semi-
hemispheric" at 0.5 degrees.  They also recommended that the models should
be run at the highest
possible resolution compatible with the data density.  Minimum
requirements for vertical
resolution at which data to be supplied to the models was set at 25
hPa between 1000 and 100
hPa,  plus the analyzed mandatory levels above 100 hPa. Values of
p-s, z-s, u-10m, v-10m, T-2m, q-2m
coherent with the data assimilation procedure were also provided along
with a coherent set of surface geophysical fields such as
SST, z0, albedo, soil-moisture, ice-cover etc, and participants were
highly recommended to  use them for their simulations.
Some of the guidelines for the participation were to insist that
the most recent version of
models be used, and that the global and regional data fields used
to drive the models be
consistent between models so as to allow for a good comparison of the LBC
driven and LBC free
approaches.
<p>
          The first COMPARE case was based on a marine cyclogenesis
event from CASP (Canadian
Atlantic Storms Project).  Analyses were prepared using the RPN/CMC
regional data assimilation
system driven by NMC global analyses. A description of these
techniques is given Chouinard
et al. (1994).  They produced a participation package consisting of
an analysis tape; reading and
decoding software; ECMWF's documentation of the GRIB format; a
tape-reading guide; a
description of suggested algorithms for interpolation and relations
between thermodynamic and
moisture variables; and a questionnaire on attributes of the
participants models.
           Chouinard noted that an important aspect of the first
experiment was to standardize
procedures so as to facilitate the running of future experiments. 
He then described the set of proposed
simulations that was to make up the first experiment. These were
basically sensitivity tests to
resolution and initial and lateral boundary conditions.
<p>
           Chouinard then presented some results from the first
project experiment, and noted the
achievements thus far of COMPARE.  The evaluation of the results of
11 modeling groups has
been completed and presented at a workshop, they developed a
software package to verify the
forecasts against a set of quality-controlled observations and analyses,
and consolidated all the results from the mesoscale
model runs into a database which was distributed, along with
visualization software to an independent evaluation group, and then
to each participant.
<p>
           Finally he noted that it had taken 5 years to get to
this stage, they had many problems
with data exchange and had to validate, separately at least 100 experiments
(visual inspection, 
they had a staff of 4.)
<p>
           Federico Mayor, Director-General of UNESCO, then briefly
addressed the workshop. 
A transcript of that address is included in <a href="#mayor">Appendix A</a>.  Mayor made
these three points: (1) we
often talk about applied science, but basic science is also very
significant: "there is no applied
science if there is no science to apply!" (2) National politicians
and ministers need more
scientific input for decision making and these scientific elements
must be presented in an
understandable way. (3) Thirty thousand Ph.D. scientists from
sub-Sahelian Africa are now
working in developed countries, where they have better
opportunities to continue their research. 
UNESCO is trying to reverse this trend by bringing scientists from
advanced countries to the
south for periods of 2-3 months to facilitate rapid transfer of
technology. <p>
<a name="semazzi"><b>Climate needs of developing countries (Semazzi)</b><p>
          
 The next speaker was Frederick Semazzi (North Carolina
State) who talked about the
climate needs of developing countries and some interesting work
relating to aspects of African
climate.  Semazzi first noted the hierarchy of climate scales which
are important to Africa
ranging from the continental to watershed scales.  He presented
some observational results from
Nicholson (1986) which showed rainfall departures over Africa for
the periods 1950 - 1959 and
1968 - 1973.  These results seemed to suggest that there were 2
modes for rainfall anomalies
in Africa, the first where central Africa is drier than normal, and
the regions north and south
are wetter than normal; and the second where central Africa is
wetter than normal and the other
regions are drier than normal.  He then showed some GCM results
from simulated years within
these periods that agreed qualitatively with the observations
(Semazzi et al., (1994a), and Semazzi et al. (1994b))<p>
           Semazzi then discussed the work of Owen et al. (1988)
about seasonal forecasts of
Sahelian rainfall made with the UKMET GCM, and the work of Semazzi et. al.
(1993) with a nested
regional model (inside CCM1) in trying to get more detail in
historical seasonal simulations of
Sahelian rainfall.  He described the urgent need for seasonal
forecasts since drought in Africa
often means famine in the afflicted areas.  He also talked about
the work of the Drought
Monitoring Center in Nairobi, and how mesoscale models might help
in decision making with
the Qattarra hydroelectric project in Egypt.  There is a plan to
fill the Qattar depression with
water from the Mediterranean via a canal. Electricity would be
generated by the flow of water
through the canal.  This flow would be sustained because of the
intense evaporation of water off
the newly created lake due to the extremely arid surroundings of
the lake and its shallowness. 
Mesoscale models could be useful in the planning of this project
since they could provide
estimates of evaporation off the lake under the new mesoscale wind
regime.  He then talked
briefly about how vegetation changes in the Amboseli National Park
of Kenya had been affected

by a prolonged wet spell, which had raised the water table enough
to reach the roots of existing
trees. Since the groundwater was highly saline, the trees died out.
<p>
           Semazzi then discussed the needs of African scientists
and institutions if they wished to
take advantage of advances in climate and mesoscale modeling.  The
basic requirements were
computing power,  maintenance, telecommunications and the
associated infrastructure,
observational data and qualified personnel.  He then went on to
discuss the modes for enhancing
opportunities in regional climate modeling in developing countries,
such as the research mode
and a semi-operational mode. This semi-operational mode, he
envisioned, would be a clearing
house for mature climate modeling research products, and would be
useful in developing a
coordinated strategy in minimizing overlap between research at the
continental, regional and
watershed scales.<p>


           After the talk there was a brief discussion of the
negative impact on scientific research
in developing countries arising from the multi-tiered data cost
structuring policies now being
adopted by some countries.<p>

<a name="witold"><b>Hydrological considerations for regional models
(Krajewski)</b></a>
<p>
           Witold Krajewski (hydrologist from the University of
Iowa), the next speaker, talked
about hydrologic considerations at continental, regional and finer
scales including issues relating
to streamflow.<p>
                     Krajewski started off by mentioning that they
were working with NASA under the
TRMM validation program.  This program has a goal of extracting
rainfall rate estimates from
both satellite and ground radar returns.  Selection of algorithms to be used
with the ground radar data is made through an intercomparison of candidate 
methods.  This framework is similar to the proposed intercomparison of the
mesoscale model discussed herein. 
Krajewski then noted that the
main characteristic of
observations of hydrologic parameters (e.g. rain rates and radar
reflectivity) were their
tremendous variability, and that the major statistical assumption
used in analysis (e.g. developing
regression relationships) is stationarity.  He also noted that
variability in rainfall pales in
comparison to the variability in hydraulic conductivity (which is
a function of soil-moisture,
which is itself highly variable - there are order-of-magnitude
differences in conductivity between
wet and dry soils, and sandy and clayey soils).  Fortunately over
time and space, nature
integrates  out much of this variability and streamflow is a
measure of this integral.  He then
demonstrated how streamflow reflects long term trends in
precipitation by showing spring
precipitation and summer streamflow autocorrelations.  He also
noted the differences in
variability in streamflows for drought and flood periods.
<p>
           Krajewski then showed some composite maps of temperature
and precipitation
correlations with summer soil-moisture levels based on the work of
Konstantine Georgakakos and his colleagues at the Hydrologic Research 
Center in San Diego.  Their work demonstrates the importance of soil
moisture in the top two metre zone in controlling summer flooding in the
Midwestern basins.
metre zone  He then showed some
scattergrams of
precipitation versus moisture convergence, evaporation and
precipitation recycling for the
Midwest, and he pointed out the location of summer of 1993 on these
scattergrams.  The results
indicated that July 93 was an outlier in terms of precipitation and
moisture convergence, but not
in terms of evaporation and percent recycled moisture. (These results were
from Allen Bradley, a hydrologist at the University of Iowa.)
<p>
           Krajewski noted that an important feature of mesoscale
model validation in terms of the
hydrological cycle is that the models must preserve the statistical
character of precipitation
variability across a range of scales.  One statistical feature important for
development of parameterizations of the hydrologic components of the climate
models is a strong linear relationship between mean areal rainfall and
fractional area covered by rain.  A similar relationship holds in time.
He then showed some scattergrams and linear
regressions from GATE I and
GATE II showing the relationship between area averaged rain rate
and fractional area coverage. 
<p>
He then talked about the River Forecast Service (RFS)
extended (1-3 month) streamflow predictions.  He demonstrated, based on
work by Georgakakos, quantitative benefits from operating water
resources systems if long term streamflow forecasts are available.
<p>

References given were Guetter and Georgakakos (1993) and Roads et
al. (1994).
<p>
           Krajewski's talk was the last of the formal
presentations. Less formal discussions
concerning the objectives of the regional climate model
intercomparison, and the design of the
initial experiment with consideration of space and time domains,
initial and lateral boundary
conditions, surface physics, convective and radiation schemes
followed.  Practical issues relating
to verification, what variables ought to be saved, standardization
of reporting procedures, and
funding sources were also discussed.
<p>
<a name="design"><b>Experiment Design</b></a><p>
<b>Mission and Action Statements</b>
<p>
           Dr. Bill Gutowski (Geological and Atmospheric Sciences
Department, Iowa State
University) then discussed the mission of the proposed
intercomparison project (See <a href=#"mission">Appendix
B</a>, for the complete text) and then a set of action statements was
agreed upon by the workshop
participants.<p>

           The mission statement adopted was "to advance the status
of regional climate modeling
by evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of current models and
their component procedures
through systematic, comparative simulations".
<p>
           The four action statements were: (1) for participants in
Project to Intercompare Regional
Climate Simulations (PIRCS - suggested name for the project) to
actually perform the
experiments, (2) to provide straightforward access for developing
countries scientists to the
datasets produced for the project by the participants, (3) to
develop collaboration between
modeling groups and researchers in developing countries who wish
greater involvement in
regional climate modeling, and (4) to coordinate its activities
with related international programs
occurring under the auspices of the WMO and the U.N. Food and
Agriculture Organization.<p>

           In the general discussion that followed the following
points were made (many of the
points raised related to the scope of the participation):<p>
<ul>
<li>Need for well organized strategy for the comparison was stressed.
<li>Use first experiment to establish procedures, infrastructure.
<li>Are we more concerned with intermodel comparisons, or within-model
comparisons which are
 more like sensitivity studies?
<li>Consider a subproject with a GCM participant.
<li>Include a variable resolution global model - but it was argued
that there might be a problem
 with providing global analyses, and others argued that emphasis
should be on limited area
 regional models, since there was an interest on LBC effects.
-<li>Exclude statistical downscaling techniques. 
</ul><p>
           There was some discussion as to the name (acronym) of
this experiment.  It was noted
that the current title (Regional-scale climate model
intercomparison project) doesn't specify
limited area domain models. It was suggested to leave out MIP since
this implied connection
with AMIP. PIRCS seemed to be the early favorite.
<p>
           It was suggested that the group encourage non-modelers
to utilize the sets of model
output generated in the form of subprojects a la AMIP. This would
also be consistent with
IITAP goals.<p>

<a name="giorgi"><b>Scientific Objectives</b></a>
<p>
           The first discussion period was led by Filipo Giorgi
(Climate and Global Dynamics
division of NCAR) and this involved the setting of scientific
objectives of this effort.  After
some time these were prioritized, as many people felt that the
experiment should be as focused
as possible, at least initially.
<p>
           Giorgi listed some general scientific objectives within
the regional climate modeling
community.  These were
<ul>
<li>to improve the spatial resolution of simulated
climates. This would help bridge the scale gap with impact models.

<li>to study the effects of local forcings/feedbacks on
regional and local climates.

<li>to test and develop physical parameterizations for
high resolution GCMs.

<li>to test the importance of resolution in the simulation
of regional climates

<li>to provide a framework for pilot coupling studies:
<ul>

	<li> model coupling (regional, ocean, ecosystem,
lake models)
	<li> data coupling (assimilation methods,
satellite data)
</ul>

 <li>to establish test cases

<li>to couple regional climate models with impact models
</ul><p>

Scientific questions that Giorgi thought ought to be answered in
this effort were suggested and
were prioritized as follows:
<p>
<ul>
<li> How do regional models represent the individual and
aggregated characteristics of
              synoptic events in climate mode where simulations are
long [i.e., long enough to
              include many events] and continuous with driving
conditions similar to GCM nesting?
 <li> How does model performance vary with geographical
region?
 <li> How well is the hydrological cycle represented in
these models?
<li> What physical parameterizations are essential (and
what improvements need to be
              made to improve) to the simulation of regional
climates?
</ul><p>
           The rest in no particular order were
<ul>
<li> What are the limitations of these models?
<li> What is the importance of domain size, vertical and horizontal
resolution, and boundary
condition assimilation?
<li> What are the effects of high resolution forcings/feedbacks?
<li> Can the models capture diurnal and seasonal cycles that are
evident in the climatic record?
<li> Do these models capture extreme climate events?
<li> What differences are there between continuous runs and those that
are constantly reinitialized?
</ul><p>

This list prompted much discussion and many points were raised
about the first experiment and
project in general, some of which were not resolved.  Listed below
are some of these points.<p>
<ul>
<li> Can we show that there is value added to the predictions of Global
Climate models, and if so
is it worth the effort? In this regard it was noted that summer
1993 was a case where
global models did poorly in positioning the areas of high rainfall,
but higher resolution models
such as the NGM did well. Arguing against this was that some people
thought that this would 
place too much importance on the cumulus parameterization schemes
in showing up differences
between the models.

<li> We should keep the experimental design and proposed model
modifications simple, at least
initially.

<li> Should we do a wintertime season for a location where there exists
a lot of variation in the
topography?

<li>  Daniela Jacob ()related the European experience with regional climate
models, she noted that all the models gave similar results and performed
adequately in the winter, whereas they still looked similar in the
summer but performed poorly.       

<li> It was argued that feedbacks should be as simplified as possible.

<li> Should the simulation domain include ocean bodies? (yes)
<li> Are we interested in seasonal simulations or predictions? How
about interannual predictions,
 i.e., if BC's contain an El Nino signal, does the regional model
produce a "local El Nino 
 response"?

<li> What is ISU/IITAP prepared to do? Able to do?

<li> How to manage, deal with participants' needs, queries and
output?

<a name="chris"><b>Time and Space Domain (Hesselbjerg
Christensen)</b></a>
<p>

           The last discussion session of the Thursday was led by
Jens Hesselbjerg Christensen
(Danish Meteorological Institute) and during this session it was
decided what the domain and
simulation period would be.
<p>
           The first experiment, designated 1a, was decided to be
a simulation of the summer 1988
drought over the central United States.  This had the advantage of
overlapping with the AMIP
simulation period.  Another potential experiment involving the
simulation of the 1993 summer,
when flooding occurred over much of the same region, was given the
designation 1b.
<p>
           Other possibilities discussed were <p>
<ul>
<li>Wintertime western U.S. (topographic forcing).
<li>Europe 92 drought.
<li>Tropics - monsoon of 87 (drought) contrasted with monsoon of 88
(normal) (India).
<li>92-93 winter in North America.
<li>East Asia monsoon of 1994.
<li>1993 summer whole US: this would include both a drought
(SouthEast) and a flood (Midwest).
</ul><p>
           One of the reasons for choosing 1a and 1b over N.
America was the availability of
observations for validation.  But it was argued that in future
experiments the same arguments
would be used against any experiments with simulation domains in
developing countries.
Therefore the participants were urged to seriously consider such a
prospect for the second
experiment.<p>

           It was suggested that experiments be done using both
ECMWF and NMC analyses in
order to address the issue of noise in LBC's.  Given the computing
limitations, it was suggested
that the internal domain be 70 (lon) x 60 (lat) x 20 (vertical -
max) with an extended grid of 10
grid points along each lateral boundary.  The resolution would be
50 or 60 km. Details of the
exact boundaries were left to be decided by someone with a map of
the proper projection and
calculator.<p>

           Other considerations<p>
<ul>
<li>How far upstream should the boundaries be to get proper moisture
influx?
<li>The regional spectral model will be a special case as it needs
global or (hemispheric analyses)
<li>There are good datasets available from GEWEX.
<li>The southern border should be off of the Mexican Plateau.
<li>Outflux areas away should be kept from region of interest.
<li>In the extended domain (relaxation area), reflection is a problem.
</ul><p>

<a name="christensen"><b>Surface forcings (Hesselbjerg
Christensen)</b></a>
<p>
Initial conditions needed are for:
<ul>
<li>Topography (care needed here due to the way some grids
are set up and the specification
            of surface pressures). The possibility of using the
Navy dataset supplied on some grid
            was suggested, though different models have different
grids.  However when analyses
            are provided we do want to supply topography as well.
<li>Soil-moisture (issue related to spin up period to get
realistic soil moisture profiles - can't
            prescribe soil moisture through the simulation).
<li>Vegetation (each model left to its own devices - though
there were strong arguments for
            a consistent treatment using plug compatible packages
<li>this was argued as being too 
            difficult to implement due to the time required to test
out any package in its new model).
<li>SST, CO2, and solar constant to be prescribed (same as
AMIP).  Prescription of land-use
            classification, soil types etc were to be left to up to
the discretion of modeling groups
            (but consistency was urged, i.e. don't want one group
prescribing forest where another
            prescribes grassland).  It was suggested that land-use
maps be supplied to the groups and
            they generate their model requirements from that, but
this too would be difficult for 
some participants to do.
<li>Deep soil temperature. 
<li>Great Lakes temperature can be supplied weekly at 14 km
resolution.
</ul><p>

At this point the group disbanded for the day.<p>

            Many attended the public lecture in the evening by Dr.
Mayor entitled <a href="http://www.physics.iastate.edu/mayor.html">"Culture of
Peace: Science, Education, and UNESCO"</a>.  At the start of the Friday
morning session,
Thursday afternoon's discussion was briefly summarized.<p>

<a name="laprise"><b>Initial and Lateral Boundary Conditions (Laprise)</b></a>
<p>
           This discussion was led by Rene Laprise of the
University of Quebec at Montreal.<p>

           One main question was whether the boundary conditions
were to be generated at ISU then
distributed? (Yes)<p>

Then 4 other questions that had to be asked and answered related to
<ul>
<li>What variables does each model require?
<ul>
    <li>       For the case of the Canadian model the required
variables are u, v, q, T, pmsl (with an
           algorithm for getting psfc, which needs topographic
information), and possibly
           geopotential heights. Discussion then centered on agreed
ways to extract the surface
           pressure.  In the end it was decided to supply T, Pmsl,
topography, and the appropriate
           algorithm.
<li>           Spectral models needed streamfunction and velocity
potential and they needed
           hemispheric analyses.

<li>           A need to ensure consistency between T, pmsl, and
geopotential in the supplied analyses
           was also stressed.
</ul>
<li>What vertical coordinate?
<ul>
<li>           The group could not agree on vertical resolution, given
the variety of coordinate systems
           used so this was left up to the individual modeling
groups.

<li>           Analysis to be done on pressure levels (every 25 mb),
then interpolated to sigma levels
           if necessary.  There was concern that information,
especially boundary layer information
           could be lost in the process.

<li>           Topography of analysis? 
</ul>
<li>What observational frequency?
<ul>
<li>           As available, with linear interpolation between times
(to be done by suppliers).
</ul>
<li>What nesting strategy to use?
<ul>
<li>           This was left as a decision up to the modelers? But the
general concept of the inner "free
           or analysis" domain would be 70 x 60, with the extended
"forcing domain" to be (90 x
           80) or at least some constraints be imposed on the
thickness of the "sponge or relaxation"
           layer; i.e., we want to specify a minimum free zone but
place an outer bound on the 
           extended domain. (Exception - regional spectral model).
It was suggested that the
           convective and radiation schemes in the models be left
as they are (for the first
           experiment), but one group was willing to test out an
excellent radiation scheme if it were
           available.
</ul>
</ul><p>
<a name="verify"><b>Verification (Chouinard)</b></a><p>

           This discussion was led by Clement Chouinard.  The first
point he made was that thought
had to put into our objectives so we could match model output to
these. Here it was decided that
we wanted to show finer detail than is currently realized by GCMs,
and that moisture, heat and
energy budgets would be key diagnostic variables.
<p>
           Output variables could be classified as  dynamical
(u,v,q,T,p,ql) and physical (fluxes).
Averages of these quantities could be sent to ISU/IITAP for
analysis, but histories could be
saved at each institution.  Hourly histories for surface budget
calculations could also be sent to
ISU/IITAP, where useful statistical diagnostics (such as monthly
means, standard deviations, etc)
or derived variables such as growing degree days could be computed. 
Other variables that were
suggested as being useful were minimum and maximum temperatures,
and vertically integrated
moisture.
<p>
           The levels at which the variables would be saved were
suggested as 250, 500, 700, 850
mb for the dynamical variables, as well as at the 10 m and 2 m
levels in the surface layer.
Precipitation and evaporation was suggested as being saved in mm
every 6 hours, and snow
depth in mm each day.
<p>
           The length of integration was decided as being two
months but thought was given to a
3 month simulation with a 1 month spin up period for soil moisture.
<p>
<a name="misc"><b>Miscellaneous</b></a><p>
           The group the went onto discuss some other miscellaneous
but nevertheless important
topics. It was suggested that the workshop endorse the idea of
encouraging an intense observing
period in order to create an African dataset.

   <p>
<a href="http://www.physics.iastate.edu/gcp/gcp.html">The IITAP global change course </a>URL was distributed.<p>

           Discussions then centered on a timetable for finalizing
a design for the first experiment -
 this was set as the end of January 1995. A workshop summary is to
be sent to the participants
by January 1, 1995.<p>
           Funding sources were then discussed.  Possibilities
included NSF, the World Bank (which
supports countries with specific projects), DOE, and with some
possible seed money from
IITAP. It was noted that with an emphasis on training developing
countries' scientists (via
IITAP) and providing them with useful tools (mesoscale models) that
their countries can use,
this project should generate a lot of interest.  A possibility of
having a future workshop
sponsored by NATO was also suggested.
<p>
           The workshop then ended.

           Transcript of Federico Mayor's (Director-General UNESCO)
remarks to the workshop.
<p>
"I would like to make three points, which for me are very
important, .... the first point,
speaking as a scientist, we talk often about applied science, I
would insist that there is no applied
science without science to apply. What I mean by this is that basic
science is always extremely
important, and that we must try to persuade the financial sources,
the government, that basic
science is extremely important.  Because, again when I was minister
of Education and Science
in my own country I remember the Minister of Finance was always
saying "Yes, but applied
research!", I was always repeating "there is no applied science if
there is no science to apply!".
It was very important because sometimes we have this kind of
disposition from the very
beginning to apply but not to make fundamental research."<p>

" ... the second point, this time as a politician, as a minister
(that I have been) I know at what
point it is important to have elements of scientific input in
decisions today.  There are many
decisions which are based on economic and social parameters. We
need more science, in such
a way that it is feasible for the politicians to realize these
elements.  We need also to make
an effort to present these elements in such a way so they
understand and take into account the
scientific input as one of the aspects of their decision. It is in
this respect, I was telling Professor
Vary, that it is our intention with UNEF and other agencies of the
United Nations and NGO's
and universities to start producing every three months a "state of
the planet report".  Every three
months, because now the reports are made every year, or every 2
years.  And for politicians this
is too long, they have more immediate problems, they need to have
this kind of scientific input
in their briefings.<p>
           And also we have some problems today that should have
more science at the municipal
level, at the village level, for example, the utilization of
fertilizers is very costly.  We have no
particular analyses of what kind of fertilizer we must utilize for
any particular soil. No guidance
to follow for recommended applications.  We aren't getting the
benefits from the fertilizer and
polluting in the process."<p>

  ...."the third point I would like to make, this time as Director
General of UNESCO is  ......
we have at this moment thirty thousand  Ph.D.'s from south Sahelian
Africa working in the most
developed countries.  Today they choose these countries in order to
do their own research.  It
is for this reason that we are talking of having the possibility of
doing the opposite; for
professors and scientists from advanced countries to go to the
south, not for many months, but
for 2 or 3 months and to make a very rapid transfer of knowledge,
in order that people can
benefit on the spot and they also have a better  feeling of
sharing, because they realize that
scientists from advanced countries are actually coming to their
country.  We create what they
say, a unity between universities and central reserve systems with
UNESCO's chairs. Here you
have a tailor made design for work. The best scientists go there
for 2 and 3 months, each one,
then in 9 months you can have a very comprehensive transfer of
knowledge".<p>
<a name ="mission"><b>Appendix B</b></a><p>

<h2>Mission</h2>

<b>To advance the status of regional climate modeling  by evaluating
the strengths and weaknesses
of limited-area models and their component procedures through
systematic, comparative
simulations.</b>
<p>
            Physically based, limited-area modeling for the purpose
of understanding regional climate,
climate change, and climate variability is rapidly increasing in
sophistication and usage.  Application
of a variety of limited-area climate models to a wide range of
problems within and beyond the
developed countries suggests that interest in this technique will
likely continue to grow.  These
applications go beyond simply modeling the local weather for
extended periods and aim at simulating
the regional, coupled system of land, atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere
and biosphere processes. 
Accordingly, diagnosis of these models typically includes monthly
or longer period statistics of
means, variances and extremes of targeted fields.  These models
have been and will continue to be
focal points for both theoretical and applied research.
<p>
            A useful approach for improving regional simulation by
limited-area models is the comparison
of simulations produced by different models with each other as well
as with available observations. 
Strengths and weaknesses of model structures, numerics and
parameterizations can be assessed side-
by-side.  The utility of model intercomparisons is greatly enhanced
if the models operate under the
same external constraints, such as dynamic and radiative input
across model boundaries.  To this end,
participants in the Project to Intercompare Regional Climate
Simulations (PIRCS) will perform a
common set of simulations with limited-area models and produce a
common output set, both designed
to highlight strengths and weaknesses of individual models and of
this general approach to simulating
regional climate.
<p>
            This intercomparison activity will proceed initially
under the auspices of the International
Institute of Theoretical and Applied Physics (IITAP) at Iowa State
University.  One mission of IITAP
is "to address basic and applied problems in environmental and
earth sciences by use of basic
physical science principles, and to use this mechanism for creating
and expanding partnerships with
scientists from developing countries to enhance local science
infrastructure."  To this end, PIRCS
will seek involvement of scientists from a wide range of countries. 
PIRCS will promote this
involvement by establishing straightforward access for  interested
researchers to model output and
verification data sets generated for the project by its
participants.  In addition, PIRCS will facilitate
the development of collaborations between modeling groups and
researchers in developing countries
who wish greater involvement in regional climate modeling.
<p>
            PIRCS will also seek to coordinate its activities with
related international programs occurring
under the auspices of the World Meteorological Organization's
Working Group on Numerical
Experimentation, the Global Energy and Water Cycles Experiment
(GEWEX), and the U.N. Food
and Agriculture Organization.  Specific programs include the
Comparison of Mesoscale Prediction
and Research Experiments (COMPARE), the Atmospheric Model
Intercomparison Experiment
(AMIP), the Project for Intercomparison of Land-surface
Parameterization Schemes (PILPS), and
the GEWEX Numerical Experiment (G-NEG).  The baseline of experience
in these and other groups
will  facilitate productive evolution of PIRCS.  Through this
coordination, PIRCS will become a
focal point for research and discussion revolving around regional
climate
simulation.
<p>
