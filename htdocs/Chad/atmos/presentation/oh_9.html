VII.  Summary
<ul>
<li>	* Recent advances in computer hardware allow for much wider
	  use of models for agroclimatic applications
<P>
<LI>	* Models can be a significant tool to empower scientists from
	  developing and developed countries to enhance their use of
	  agroclimatic databases for a more efficient and sustainable
	  agriculture
<P>
<LI>	* The International Institute for Theoretical and Applied Physics
	  at Iowa State University has a mission to train scientists
	  from developing countries in state-of-the-art tools for basic
	  and applied physics problems including modeling and analysis
	  with agroclimatic databases
