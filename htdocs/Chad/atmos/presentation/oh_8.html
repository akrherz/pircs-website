VI. Technology transfer- to developing countries
<ul>
<LI>	A. Computing hare for running meteorological
           models now costs less than the anual salary 
           of the scientist to operate it
<P>
<LI>	B. Availability of inexpensive data storage, high-volume
           data storage. high-speed retrieval and global
	   communication systems makes data more widely accessible
	   for research and operational applications
<P>
<LI>	C. Assistance in training scientists from developing countries
	   in the use of models and data analysis will
           become available through the International Institute
           for Theoretical and Applied Physics at Iowa State University
<P>
