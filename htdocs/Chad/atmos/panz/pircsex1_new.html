<a name="motiv"><b><h2>MOTIVATION</h2></b></a>
<p>The intent of the first experiment is to provide a first comparison of how well regional models 
represent aggregate characteristics of weather events in a simulation long enough to include many 
such events, i.e. resolve climate.  To this end, the experiment is designed to be relatively simple to 
perform and diagnose thereby facilitating wide-spread participation and the establishment of a 
framework for ongoing intercomparison.  The experiment will contain the strong climate signals 
of persistent extreme events, which are expected to simplify the intercomparison by focusing 
diagnosis on dominant processes during these events.</p>
<p>
This intercomparison is being coordinated by the International Institute of Theoretical and 
Applied Physics (IITAP), which has a goal of promoting the application of forefront scientific 
tools to practical problems facing scientists in developing countries.  The initial experiment 
focuses on a primarily agricultural region with significant vulnerability to growing season 
precipitation, a problem common to most developing countries.  Accordingly, one emphasis of the 
intercomparison will be diagnosing the simulation of hydrologic processes.  In order to 
complement related research programs, the initial experiment is also designed to overlap with 
activities of COMPARE, GEWEX (specifically G-NEG and GCIP) and AMIP.</p>
<a name="locat"><b><h2>LOCATION</h2></b></a>
<p>
The first experiment will focus on the central United States, a region of intense cultivation 
containing a major watershed, the Mississippi River basin. It is a region that has experienced 
episodes of both extreme drought and extreme flooding within the past 10 years.  This region is 
also the focus of GCIP and planned activities by G-NEG.</p>
<a name="perio"><b><h2>PERIOD</h2></b></a>
<p>
The first experiment will contain two periods:  the summer of 1988 drought (Expt. 1a) and the 
summer of 1993 flooding (Expt. 1b).  Experiment 1a emphasizes thermal processes, whereas 
Experiment 1b emphasizes processes of the water cycle.  Initial simulation and diagnosis will 
focus on the summer of 1988, but the coupled diagnosis of opposite extremes will constitute a 
more complete analysis of the systematic behavior of participating models.  Simulations will be 
initialized using gridded analyses for 15 May 1988 and 1 June 1993 and will last 60 days.  The 
starting dates represent times by which persistent  circulation features for each summer had 
become established.<p>
<a name="simdo"><b><h2>SIMULATION DOMAIN</h2></b></a>
<p>The simulation domain will consist of two parts:  a forced outer frame and a "free" inner domain.  
Diagnostics will be computed for the inner domain.  The standard inner domain will be given by a 
51 (N-S) x 101 (E-W) lat-lon grid with 1/2 degree resolution, with the central point located in the middle of the U.S. (lat. grid #26, lon. grid #51) =
(37.5 N, 100 W)
<a href=pircsreg.gif>(Fig. 1)</a>.</p>
<p>The PIRCS support staff has designed a nearly equivalent inner domain for models using a 
polar stereographic projection with the central point (X grid #28, Y grid#41) =
(37.5 N, 100 W)
 <a href=pircspsg.gif>(Fig. 2)</a>.</p>
<p>Models using other projections should use a grid that 
marginally covers all of the inner domain.  Any projection onto a Cartesian grid should use a 60 
km horizontal resolution.  The standard outer frame is an additional 10 grid points on each side of 
the inner domain, for both the lat-lon and polar stereographic grids.  The design of the inner 
domain attempts to include major, central-U.S. moisture sources in the Pacific and Gulf of 
Mexico while avoiding an excessive computing burden from too many grid points.  The domain as 
a whole is also designed to minimize the occurrence of high topography along the boundaries.</p>
<p>Precise structure of the inner and outer domains may vary between models depending on their 
numerical procedures.  It is expected that participants in the intercomparison will use the lateral 
boundary conditions given in the outer frame as appropriate for their model and that no model 
will include explicit external forcing within the domain covered by the standard "free" grid.</p>
<p>In the vertical direction, each model will use its own coordinate, grid and resolution:  there is no 
standard vertical grid.</p>
<a name="ilbcs"><b><h2>ATMOSPHERIC INITIAL AND LATERAL BOUNDARY CONDITIONS </h2></b></a>
<p>
The PIRCS support staff will provide initial conditions for the simulation domain described above 
from re-analysis output produced by the U.S. National Meteorological Center.  In order to 
facilitate the participation of a wide variety of models, and guided by the COMPARE program, 
PIRCS will distribute data on three grids:  a background, global grid at 2 1/2 degree resolution, 
forcing-frame (outer domain) data at 1/2 degree resolution on the lat-lon grid, and forcing-frame 
data at 60 km resolution on the polar stereographic grid.  Data for lateral boundary conditions will 
be provided every 6 hours. </p>
<p>The variables provided will be the horizontal wind components (u, v), temperature T, specific 
humidity q, the surface pressure p_sfc of the reanalysis model and the topography used by the re-analysis model.  Data will be provided at 25 mb resolution.  PIRCS will provide the algorithm for 
vertical interpolation of surface pressure to the individual model's topographic height.</p>
<a name="sfccd"><b><h2>SURFACE CONDITIONS</h2></b></a>
<p>
The PIRCS support staff will provide soil-moisture for initial conditions and periodic ocean and 
lake surface temperatures for lower boundary conditions.  For a number of reasons, precise 
determination of the field of soil moisture on each starting date will be difficult.  The soil-moisture 
conditions that will be distributed are intended to provide a consistent, reasonably accurate initial 
condition for all models.  Therefore, while these values can be converted to units appropriate for 
each model, they should not be adjusted toward drier or more moist conditions.
</p>
<p>For simplicity, each modeling group is encouraged to use their model's topography and land 
characterization procedures already established for this region, if they exist.  The PIRCS support 
staff, however, will provide a reference topography and land-characterization dataset for 
participants needing this information.</p>
<a name="cvrad"><b><h2>CONVECTION AND RADIATION</h2></b></a>
<p>
The choice of cumulus convection and radiation schemes is left to each modeling group.</p>
<a name="diagn"><b><h2>DIAGNOSTICS</h2></b></a>
<p>Primary diagnostics will consist of heat, moisture and energy budgets on scales finer than typically 
resolved by global models.  All spatially varying output should be reported on the model's grid for 
the inner domain.  The PIRCS archive will collect from each participating group four sets of data,
<A HREF="http://www.physics.iastate.edu/atmos/table1.html">(Table 1)</A>.  The hourly data will enable an assessment of time-average energy and water budgets 
and links between the surface and atmosphere.  The multi-day averages will be used to assess the 
ability of the models to simulate mean behavior of specific episodes and to monitor model drift.</p>
<p>Participants will be strongly encouraged to save at their institutions hourly histories of the 
prognostic variables.  PIRCS requests that archives contain sufficient history
information so that comparisons that are either unanticipated by PIRCS or 
that go beyond the scope of the initial comparison may still be performed.
Examples of the latter would include analysis of vertical fluxes of heat
and moisture generated by convection and their impact on resolved dynamics and
study of the interaction between clouds in the planetary boundary layer (PBL),
radiation and other PBL processes.
</p>

<p>For Expt. 1a (drought year), diagnostic emphasis for the intercomparison will be on the evolution 
of the thermal processes across the domain, as characterized by the surface and atmospheric 
thermal energy budgets.  A comparison of hydrologic processes for this case of weak hydrologic 
cycle will also be performed, but it is expected that this comparison in particular will not be 
complete until the strong hydrologic cycle of the 1993 flood period is also simulated and 
diagnosed.</p>

<a name="fnote"><b><h2>FINAL NOTES</h2></b></a>
<ul>
<LI>The time table is tentative and somewhat dependent on the
availability of external funding support.
<br>
<br>
<LI>The five-day boundary conditions data set will enable interested
groups to perform a partial PIRCS run and assess whether or not 
they can commit the resources necessary for the project.
<br>
<br>
<LI>We will package the full 60-day boundary-conditions data set for
groups that formally register.  The dataset will be in GRIB format.
<br>
<br>
<LI>Formal registration will include providing a description of the
 participating model's components and the grid to be used.  PIRCS will
supply the reporting format.
