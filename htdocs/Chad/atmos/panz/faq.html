<h3> About initial and boundary conditions </h3>
<pre>
Q: How many vetical levels are there in experiment 1?
<br>
A: Forty two levels from 25 mb (1st level) down to 1050 mb 
   (42nd) at 25 mb interval.
<br><br>
Q: Should there be a file which defines lat/lon for the half 
   degree grid? 
<br><br>
A: The domain configuration of the 0.5x0.5 degree lat/lon is 
    as following:
<br><br>
   NW corner  (1,YMAX).......................(XMAX,YMAX) NE Corner <br>
<br><br>
              ...........(I,J)............... 
              ............................... 
<br><br>
              (1,2) .........................(XMAX,2)
   SW Corner  (1,1) .........................(XMAX,1) SE Corner
<br><br>
   The lat/lon is at SW corner (130.0 W, 20.0 N),
                     NE        ( 70.0 W, 55.0 N),
                   center      (100.0 W, 37.5 N).

   More info. can be found on the web (betatest, fig.2.2, <A href="Pircsdata_new.html#prcdo">PIRCS domain</A>).<br>

Q: I would like to know where I could get information on what the number 
   means in the landuse file (i.e. LNDF60k.88051500)
<br><br>
A: First of all, the actual number in the file should be the max (14) 
   minus this number. For example, 5 stands for 9 (=14-5).

         1 -- Urban land 
         2 -- Agriculture
         3 -- Range-grassland
         4 -- Deciduous forest
         5 -- Coniferous forest
         6 -- Mixed forest and wet land
         7 -- Water
         8 -- Marsh or wet land
         9 -- Desert
        10 -- Tundra
        11 -- Permanent ice
        12 -- Tropical or sub-tropical forest
        13 -- Savannah

Q: Is PIRCS dataset available at other sites aside from Iowa
   State University?

A: Yes. As a backup in case of network failure or slowness, we have
   loaded PIRCS dataset at NCAR. They are in MSS (mass storage
   system). The directories are:
 
         /ZPAN/PIRCS_EPRI/PSTDOM60k/PRCF60k.880515-31.tar
                                   /PRCF60k.880601-15.tar
                                   /PRCF60k.880616-30.tar
                                   /PRCF60k.880701-15.tar
         /ZPAN/PIRCS_EPRI/REGDOM0p5/PRCF0p5.880515-31.tar
                                   /PRCF0p5.880601-15.tar
                                   /PRCF0p5.880616-30.tar
                                   /PRCF0p5.880701-15.tar

   These are large data files excluding smaller ones which can
   be easily downloaded by other means. 

   In order to download them, one has to have a "shavano" 
   account at NCAR.

<h3> About output variables </h3>

Q: What is deep-soil heat flux in list of PIRCS-collecting variables? 
<br><br>
A: Soil moisture content (flux) is one of the most loosely defined
   variables. Considering the vast varieties of soil/surface modules 
   among different models, PIRCS just intends to intercompare the
   gross features of soil properties. To this end, the deep-soil
   heat flux generally means the heat flux at the bottom of the 
   lowest model layer, assuming most models have a couple of soil 
   layers, say, 0-10 cm, 10-50 cm, 50-200 cm ... 
<br><br>

Q: I would like to know how to define the mixed-layer
   depth, especially in cloudy conditions and night time.
<br><br>
A: Mixed-Layer Depth in PIRCS is defined based on the potential 
   temperature profile. The top of the mixed layer should be the 
   midpoint of the model layer closest to the surface for which 
   the potential temperature change with height, d(theta)/dz, 
   exceeds +1 K/km. In case of multiple such layers under cloudy 
   conditions, only the FIRST one from the ground is considered. 
   Please note that when the surface layer is stably stratified, 
   the mixed layer depth is zero.
<br><br>
Q: What is the plant available soil moisture? 
<br><br>
A: The plant available soil moisture in the table is mainly referring 
   to the unit of soil moisture (in terms of access above wilting 
   points). PIRCS wants to collect soil moisture over a depth equivalent 
   to the root zone, which is about 100 cm. Again, a specific definition 
   for root zone is difficult among different model groups. Thus, we ask 
   participants to save soil moisture content in all model layers 
   because we do not know how complex soil modules are on average. 
   (Please see <A href="Pircsdata_new.html#sfcfld">initial soil moisture</A>)
<br><br>

Q: We have a model level which is not many meters away. Can this
   be a substitute for 500-m level for the purpose the leve-level
   jet diagnosis?
<br><br>
A: (1) the LLJ is (by definition) a region of strong wind shear, 
   so the wind differs substantially over a small increment of 
   height, and (2) we get into the question of how close is close 
   enough. Because of the nature of the PIRCS (INTERCOMPARISON), 
   please do interpolate winds to 500 AGL.
