        PIRCS is a community-based project, organized under the auspices of
the International Institute of Theoretical and Applied Physics (IITAP) at
Iowa State University, to intercompare regional models run in climate mode.
PIRCS will consist of a series of collaborative intercomparison
experiments using different mesoscale models to simulate the climate of the
Central US for a 60-day period beginning 15 May during the drought year of
1988 (Exp. 1a) and a follow-on 60-day experiment for the Midwest flood
period beginning 1 June 1993 (Exp. 1b).  These are periods and a region
that the GEWEX Numerical Experimentation Panel has targeted for simulation
by regional-scale models.  These simulations will provide an opportunity to
evaluate local and remotve influences on the water cycle of the Central US.
In addition, Expt. 1a emphasizes thermal and dynamical processes and is
intended to provide an initial comparison of how well regional models
represent aggregate characteristics of weather events in a simulation long
enough to include many such events (i.e., to simulate regional climate)
during a period when surface thermal forcing within the domain is large and
precipitation and latent-heat effects are minimal.  Expt. 1b emphasizes
processes of the water cycle and will examine strengths and weaknesses of
parameterizations of precipitation.

        Model simulations will be performed by the participating research
groups at their own expense;  the research herein proposed focuses on the
intercomparison of these simulations.  PIRCS will provide the management of
datasets, including initialization, boundary conditions, and simulated
results, using procedures and protocols consistent with other large
intercomparison projects and is working with other international numerical
modeling programs including COMPARE, GEWEX  [specifically the GEWEX
Numerical Experimentation Panel (GNEP) and GCIP], AMIP, and with the WGNE
to ensure coordination with related experiments.  A five-day beta-test data
set is currently available as a prototype experiment to interested
modelers.
