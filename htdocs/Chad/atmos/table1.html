____________________________________________________________________

<b>HOURLY</b>
Average of data over the previous hour (e.g., output at 12Z is average over
period from 11Z - 12Z).

1.  Surface fluxes  [all in W m-2, except precipitation]
	(a) incident solar (shortwave) radiation
	(b) reflected solar (shortwave) radiation
	(c) upward terrestrial (longwave) radiation
	(d) downward terrestrial (longwave) radiation
	(e) sensible heat flux
	(f) deep-soil heat flux
	(g) latent heat flux (evapotranspiration)
	(h) precipitation [mm month-1]

2.  Top-of-atmosphere fluxes  [all in W m-2]
	(a) net solar (shortwave) radiation
	(b) upward terrestrial (longwave) radiation

3.  Mass
	(a) surface pressure  [Pa]
	(b) precipitable water  [m]

4.  Atmospheric vertical profiles on model grid, at selected gridpoints
	(a) temperature [K]
	(b) specific humidity [kg kg-1]
	(c) zonal (east-west) wind  [m s-1]
	(d) meridional (north-south) wind  [m s-1]
	(e)  vertical wind [m s-1]
	(f) geopotential height  [m]
	(g) pressure [Pa]

5.  Low-Level Jet
	(a) meridional wind at 500 m above ground level [m/s]
	(b) zonal wind at 500 m above ground level [m/s]

6.  Mixed-Layer Depth [m]
(defined to be the midpoint of the model layer closest to the surface for
which the potential temperature change with height, d(theta)/dz, exceeds +1
K/km)

DAILY

1.  1.5 meter (screen height) temperature  [K]
	(a) Daily maximum and time of maximum (period:  6UTC - 6 UTC)
	(b) Daily minimum and time of minimum   (period:  6 UTC - 6 UTC)

2.  Soil moisture at 12 UTC for each layer of the soil model used

5-DAY AVERAGE

Output averaged over successive 5-day periods, yielding 12 periods for the
60-day simulation.  Output should be interpolated to the levels 1000 mb,
925 mb, 850 mb, 700 mb, 500 mb, 400 mb, 300 mb and 200 mb.  Horizontal wind
components should be the true east-west and north-south components.

1.  Temperature  [K]
2. Specific humidity  [kg kg-1]
3. Zonal (east-west) wind  [m s-1]
4. Meridional (north-south) wind  [m s-1]
5. Geopotential height  [m]
