<H2>Session 1. Thursday Morning 5 December</H2>

<P>James Vary welcomed participants on behalf of the International Institute
of Theoretical and Applied Physics (IITAP). IITAP was established in 1993
under joint sponsorship of UNESCO and Iowa State University, with a vision
to build global networks of scientists cooperating to solve forefront and
pressing problems. The Institute was initially patterned after the International
Center for Theoretical Physics in Trieste, Italy. The scope of IITAP is
broader than &quot;physics&quot; and includes the physical sciences and
engineering as well as certain aspects of the life sciences where physics
plays a role. IITAP works with corporate sponsors who have an interest
in fostering international scientific collaborations and first-rate science.
Other areas of IITAP include computers and communications, applied science
and materials science. Through its evolving global network, IITAP is effective
in expanding research projects to include talented scientists from developing
regions. </P>

<P>Maurice Blackmon, Director of Climate and Global Dynamics Division (CGD)
of NCAR, welcomed the participants. Despite the &quot;global&quot; name,
CGD does have regional activities. Over the next 10 years even NCAR may
not be an appropriate name because of the interdisciplinary nature of research
(e.g., oceans, ecosystems, economics) at the Center. CGD is interested
in building partnerships and has provided the Community Climate Model (CCM).
They recently released a Climate System Model (CSM) with atmosphere, ocean,
land surface and sea ice. They also have a project to develop a modern
regional climate model.</P>

<P> Gene Takle then discussed the mission statement of IITAP Environmental
and Earth Sciences Thrust Area, including the need to bring in scientists
from developing countries. He gave a brief overview of the morning's agenda.

<H2>PRESENTATION:</H2>

<CENTER><P><A NAME="wigley"></A></P></CENTER>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Mesoscale Model Climate Simulations: Advantages and Disadvantages
for Impacts Assessment</H3>

<CENTER><P><A HREF="mailto:wigley@meeker.ucar.edu">Tom Wigley<BR>
</A>NCAR/CGD</P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P> This presentation raised a number of questions: How good are
climate models? (A subsidiary question is &quot;how good do the models
need to be?&quot;) Downscaling procedures depend on how well the global
model can simulate atmospheric circulation as a driver for statistical
or dynamic downscaling. AMIP results (from IPCC) show models are not particularly
good at simulating MSL pressure and its year-to-year variability. How should
we validate regional models; what are the needs of impacts models? Coupled
ocean-atmosphere models from IPCC chapter 6 show large errors (up to 10-15
degrees C temperature error, 200% for precipitation for scales of 300-3000
km) with large model- to-model variability. The NCAR CSM appears to do
well. Regional climate models at about 50 km resolution with boundary conditions
constrained to be correct show seasonal mean temperature errors up to 2
degrees C and seasonal mean precipitation errors up to 40%, but this is
not a clean test because of boundary-condition constraints (from IPCC).
Results from the nested regional climate model of Great Britain's Hadley
Centre represent the general spatial pattern, though absolute values can
show large errors. </P></CENTER>

<P>How do we validate regional climate models given boundary constraints?
A naive approach could be: develop regression relationships between boundary
and interior as a baseline; then ask, can a regional climate model beat
this? Another problem is &quot;uncertainty propagation&quot;. High resolution
boundary conditions reduce interior error but then do we gain much from
using the regional climate model? What if boundaries are erroneous? Another
issue: how does boundary error affect the interior simulation? A possible
resolution is to add errors to boundaries in present-day simulations and
evaluate their effects. Impacts studies need primary variables (max/min
temp, wind speed, etc.), so we need to test how well models reproduce these
primary variables. Required time resolution will vary depending on application.
We may need ensembles of climate-impacts results; maybe extrapolate from
a single realization. What spatial scales are needed? Signal-to-noise ratio
deteriorates as the spatial scale decreases. To what extent do we really
care about very small-scale impacts: can we aggregate to reduce errors?
Statistical downscaling may be as or more useful because they (1) easily
allow multiple realizations, (2) preserve spatio-temporal autocorrelation
structure and inter-variable correlation, and (3) are computationally less
demanding. </P>

<H2>PRESENTATION:</H2>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Impacts Assessments using Mesoscale Climate Simulations:
Experiences at NCAR </H3>

<CENTER><P><A HREF="mailto:lindam@ucar.edu">Linda Mearns<BR>
</A>NCAR/ESIG</P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P> These studies mainly used F. Giorgi's Regional Climate Model
(RegCM). Topics included comparative spatial scales of impacts (mesoscale
vs GCM) and incorporation of changes in climatic variability. Studies included
NIGEC Great Plains center study, MECCA, NASA/EPA, NASA, NSF-MMIA, NOAA
(Great Lakes; developed before its time). In the effect of spatial scales
on validation of crop models (EPIC-corn model), there seems to be a critical
threshold scale at which the crop model validates well. RegCM is used for
high frequency climate variability. Two assertions are: 1) less uncertainty
in validation because high-order moments change rapidly over space and
less scale mismatch with observations, and 2) clearer signals in perturbed-versus
-control. For the MECCA study, the RegCM was nested within the GENESIS
model of S. Thompson and D. Pollard (NCAR). Using CERES-Wheat for a single
point near Goodland KS, variability changes are potentially important in
agriculture impacts. A stochastic generator was used to stimulate short
term variability, particularly in precipitation. Important goals are providing
scenarios to other NIGEC investigators with guide for appropriate use,
annotation of scenarios (e.g., likely errors), and compare RegCM results
with statistically downscaled results. The CSIRO R21 GCM also has been
coupled with RegCM. The RegCM model overpredicts the frequency of light
rain events. Variance of daily radiation also is much higher in the model
than in observations. The spatial pattern of yields is sometimes good and
sometimes poor. Conducting this kind of research is harder than expected
because of the following problems: funding is difficult for interdisciplinary
research; there is a need for close collaborations among modelers, scenario
formers and impacts researchers; it is difficult to specify validation
and development of criteria for acceptably accurate control run; determining
relative &quot;validity&quot; of different variables; specific recommendations
for responsible use of model output; and that model detail doesn't equate
to greater accuracy.</P></CENTER>

<P> <B>Question:</B> Will guidelines for NIGEC be put on the web?<BR>
<B>Mearns:</B> Yes, by late spring.<BR>
<B>Comment (Takle):</B> There also is a web site and electronic dialog

<H2>PANEL DISCUSSION:</H2>

<P><A HREF="mailto:kuo@ucar.edu">B. Kuo</A> (NCAR/MMM) and <A HREF="mailto:machenhauer@dkrz.de">B.
Machenhauer</A> (MPI)</P>

<P> <B>Kuo:</B> Limitations for mesoscale models include limited horizontal
domain, and sensitivity to lateral boundary conditions (BC). Model systematic
error and &quot;climate drift&quot; often are not known (because of changes
in setup from one application to another). The model climate is strongly
dictated by lateral BC from the driving model. Opportunities include better
regional climate simulations, improve physical parameterizations in GCMs,
study impact of physics or numerics on climate. Coupling usually is one-way,
i.e. mesoscale model is a sophisticated dynamical interpolator. Can the
mesoscale model feed back to the GCM? There has recently been developed
a coupled atmosphere-ocean version of MM5. Other problems include differences
between short-term and climate simulations (sensitivity to initial condition,
choice of physical parameterization). Nesting MM5 can give a cloud model
within a regional model. Terrain height is much better preserved in high-resolution
grids.</P>

<P> Kuo showed numerous examples illustrating these points. CCM2 radiation
produced much better results for the East Asian monsoon (compared with
Dudhia radiation), but replacing the Grell convective parameterization
with Kain-Fritsch greatly improved the Dudhia results. There is a clear
need to quantify systematic biases in mesoscale climate models, and to
evaluate the ability of mesoscale models to simulate present climate before
performing simulations of projected climate. Other goals are to assess
the value and importance of two-way interactive nesting and to explore
coupled atmosphere-ocean mesoscale models for regional climate. </P>

<P><B>Machenhauer</B> discussed limited area models DK-LAM and HIRHAM.
Simulations depend greatly on physical parameterizations. Higher resolution
in the global model can produce worse results in surface pressure (e.g.,
exacerbation of negative pressure errors because of more developed cyclones).
Unresolved questions include: How do mesoscale simulations differ from
global simulations? How do climate simulations differ from several-day
simulations? Feedback regimes can amplify errors (soil dries out, causing
reduced precipitation, so that the soil dries more).</P>

<H2>OVERALL GOALS OF THE WORKSHOP</H2>

<P>Chuck Hakkarinen then discussed why EPRI is involved in this topic.
He discussed results and recommendation from the London IPCC workshop.
The preferred path to the Third Assessment Report (TAR) would take 6 years,
but completion is desired about 2000-2001. How can this process be fast-tracked?
Short-circuiting, such as using provisional emissions scenarios, could
reduce the time to 4-5 years. GCM and other work could be accelerated using
the new NCAR C90 supercomputer, if computational time can be obtained on
it. Hakkarinen encouraged that a coordinated research proposal be submitted
from this group for the Cray time. Proposals are due by 17 January 1997
for computations scheduled to begin on 1 March 1997. Other technical points
are important, such as the need to make sure what variables are saved for
later use by the impacts modeling community. </P>

<H2>Session 2. Thursday Afternoon 5 December</H2>

<H2>SUMMARIES FROM THE FIRST BREAK-OUT GROUP DISCUSSIONS</H2>

<P>These questions formed a starting point for discussion: </P>

<UL>
<LI>What mesoscale model output must be archived for impacts assessment?
</LI>

<LI>How frequently should the model simulation be sampled? </LI>

<LI>What cumulative output must be archived? </LI>

<LI>What are the error estimates for the model output? </LI>

<LI>How much do these errors contaminate the impact assessments? </LI>

<LI>Are there assessments that can not be done at the current state-of-the-science
modeling? </LI>

<LI>Should known biases in model output be adjusted, even though this may
upset the physical consistency of the output? </LI>
</UL>

<P>The <A HREF="http://www.physics.iastate.edu/atmos/table1.html">PIRCS
dataset</A> was offered as a starting point. </P>

<P><B>Group 1 (Chair - <A HREF="mailto:gcarmich@icaen.uiowa.edu">Carmichael</A>):</B>
<A HREF="http://www.pik-potsdam.de/~bahc/">The Biosphere Aspects of the
Hydrologic Cylcle (BAHC)</A> program has produced a list of spatial and
temporal resolutions and data requirements that are common to ecological
and hydrological modeling (Table 1, BAHC Focus 4, 1993). Items on this
list produced by mesoscale models are precipitation amounts and type, daily
minimum/maximum air temperature, global and net solar radiation, vapor-pressure
deficit, wind speed, and pressure. All variables should be for the surface
(editors' note: care must be taken to specify what is meant by 'surface'
and descriptions need to be given on how some variables (e.g., wind speed
and temperature) were obtained at the specified level). Target horizontal
resolution is 10 km. Daily variables are preferred, although monthly values
may be sufficient for some impacts studies. The group suggested additions
motivated by health impacts: nighttime temperatures, rainfall intensities,
water-flow and air-flow stagnation periods, atmospheric boundary-layer
inversion heights, and cloud cover. Additional quantities are suggested
by agricultural concerns: timing of freeze, dew duration, runoff, soil
moisture. Some of these variables, however, might be better obtained from
off-line computations in which model output is post-processed for the desired
fields. Any calculations producing output not directly computed by the
model for its own simulation must be carefully annotated. The group also
suggested some standards for mesoscale model comparisons to aid impacts
assessors: annotation of model parameterizations, and the length and number
of runs needed to get representative statistics. The group also asked some
additional questions: How does one derive necessary statistics from short-time
regional simulations? Is there too much attention on internal mesoscale-model
processes and initialization versus treatment of boundary conditions? </P>

<P><B>Group 2 (Chair - <A HREF="mailto:strzepek@colorado.edu">Strzepek</A>):</B>
Many of the group's comments mirror those reported for Group 1. In addition,
particular emphasis was placed on the desire for modelers to archive surface
variables at least daily. Also, desired spatial resolutions are regionally
dependent and are based in part on the need to resolve land-use and topographic
patterns. Simulations used for impacts assessment need to be long enough
to capture extreme events. It is much more important to increase the length
of simulation than to improve spatial resolution. Appropriate mesoscale
model simulations may not become available in time for impacts assessment
for the IPCC Third Assessment Report, so statistical downscaling is also
needed. Finally, care must be taken when nesting mesoscale models in GCMs
to ensure compatibility of physical parameterizations.</P>

<P> <B>Group 3 (Chair - <A HREF="mailto:n.w.arnell@soton.ac.uk">Arnell</A>):</B>
Again, many of the comments mirrored those of Groups 1 and 2. Even if a
modeler archives a field such as evapotranspiration (ET), it is desirable
to give impacts assessors the information they need to calculate ET in
their impacts models. (Such an off-line calculation may also provide a
useful check on mesoscale model performance.) Reliable estimates of changes
in variability as well as means are needed when comparing &quot;control&quot;
and &quot;perturbed&quot; model runs. In addition, it was recommended that
modelers archive their clear-sky radiative fluxes at the top and bottom
of the atmosphere, as well as cloud cover. These fields are needed to assess
biases in model radiative forcing. The impacts community needs to know
meaning and units of mesoscale model outputs in order to understand their
limitations and use them properly. Two methods of using model output were
identified: direct transfer of mesoscale-model output into impact-assessment
models; and indirect usage, in which the output is post-processed, perhaps
by using a weather generator or other statistical functions, before feeding
into an impacts model. Error tolerances for impact studies need to be recognized:
noisy high-resolution output is not worth having for impact models. This
tolerance depends on the geographic area under consideration. Some assessments
probably cannot be done using output from mesoscale models, because the
length of runs for the foreseeable future will be too short. An example
is the interdecadal variability needed for forest models. </P>

<H2>FURTHER DISCUSSION AFTER GROUP REPORTS:</H2>

<P><B>Question:</B> How long do runs have to be? </P>

<P><B>Response:</B> It depends on the area. Arid climates would need longer
simulations than Europe. The Hadley Centre has done 30 years with limited-area
model. </P>

<P><B>Comment:</B> Gates did a paper in the 1970's studying how long a
run is needed based on error tolerances, but apparently no one has done
the calculations for mesoscale-model simulations. </P>

<P><B>Comment:</B> There is a need for day-to-day rainfall that is necessarily
related to the intensity of rainfall. </P>

<P><B>Comment:</B> Paul Epstein (Harvard) has stressed the importance [for
health impacts] of understanding nighttime temperatures in regions of large
topographic gradients. </P>

<H2>PRESENTATION:</H2>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Development of a Regional Climate Model</H3>

<CENTER><P><A HREF="mailto:giorgi@ucar.edu">Filippo Giorgi<BR>
</A>NCAR/CGD</P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P> Regional Climate Models (RegCMs) have evolved from existing
mesomodels such as the Penn State/NCAR MM4 through upgrades in physical
parameterizations, especially radiation and surface physics. New routines
are added by using interface routines to pass information; the parameterizations
are changed as little as possible. The performance of new schemes is generally
tested using real-world test cases in which observational analyses (&quot;perfect&quot;
boundary conditions) drive the model so that output can be compared with
observations such as station data.</P></CENTER>

<P> Potential interfacing problems involving units, grid structure, call
frequency, etc., must be resolved. Recognizing the spatial-temporal scale
of the intended application is important, as model performance can vary
with climate and region. The choice of new parameterizations can be driven
by need to improve model performance and/or computational efficiency; e.g.,
Holtslag PBL to reduce accumulation of moisture in low levels. Model application
to new regions or types of studies can also drive implementation of new
processes, as can maximization of consistency with a driving GCM. Some
aspects of parameterizations may also need to be modified for long runs
or high resolution. However, newer and presumably better schemes do not
always lead to improved results without proper tuning. In addition, a mesoscale
model and a driving GCM should have consistency in their component processes.
They do not necessarily need the same parameterizations: schemes used in
coarse resolution GCMs may not be suitable for high resolution regional
climate models.</P>

<P> When implementing new parameterizations, extensive testing should be
done over different regions, spatial resolutions and temporal scales (daily,
seasonal, interannual). The use of these models for impacts assessment
has provided useful feedback on integrated model performance. One should
also explore model sensitivity to variations in key parameters in the new
parameterization. Parameters may need to be re-tuned for proper interaction
with other model components. Their tuning may also change with location.
Giorgi and Marinucci have studied the sensitivity of parameterizations
to resolution in the NCAR RegCM2. Resolution changes have effects distinct
from the resolution of topography (these effects happen even over the ocean).</P>

<P> Upgrading parameterizations or adding new ones produces a hopefully
more accurate, physically comprehensive and computationally efficient model.
However, a bigger model becomes more difficult to maintain and, with every
major change, the modeler also loses the experience base gained with the
previous model version. The direction for regional model development is
no longer only as physically based downscaling tools, but as entities in
themselves.</P>

<P> </P>

<H3>DISCUSSION:</H3>

<P><B>Question:</B> Is there a simple formula to calculate projected computing
time for a given domain, run length, etc.? </P>

<P><B>Response:</B> Yes, for a given model it is fairly easy. </P>

<P><B>Question:</B> What are systematic errors in your model? </P>

<P><B>Response: </B>Performance depends on region and season. Adjustments
can be made for specific applications but only occasionally are the adjustments
generally applicable. The model described here tends to over predict frequency
of precipitation events. </P>

<P><B>Question:</B> Does input for adjustment use GCM output? </P>

<P><B>Response:</B> No, tuning is done with observed boundary conditions.
</P>

<P><B>Comment:</B> Tuning for current climate may introduce errors for
future climate simulation. </P>

<P><B>Response:</B> Some of the schemes are extremely sensitive to certain
parameters; for example, the Grell scheme is very sensitive to the fraction
of precipitation that is evaporated in down drafts. </P>

<P><B>Question:</B> At some point will regional climate models have a comprehensive
set of sub-models? </P>

<P><B>Response:</B> Yes. We are trying to follow the lead of CSM. </P>

<P><B>Question:</B> The problem of time and spatial scale becomes more
complex. Can errors be attributable to numerical problems as well as physical
parameterizations? </P>

<P><B>Response:</B> Yes, although I have looked mainly at physics. For
example, the Kuo scheme depends on the delta-x used to compute moisture
convergence. </P>

<H2>SUMMARIES FROM THE SECOND BREAK-OUT GROUP DISCUSSIONS</H2>

<P>These questions formed a starting point for discussion: </P>

<UL>
<LI>What are the next candidates for internalization? </LI>

<LI>Are there specific input needs for a process module that are best satisfied
by direct coupling? </LI>

<LI>What new, potentially significant feedbacks are introduced? </LI>

<LI>What are the impediments to direct coupling of a process? </LI>

<LI>What is the computational burden of internalizing a process? Does internalizing
allow one to obtain an impact assessment more efficiently? </LI>

<LI>What other costs and advantages are there to direct coupling? </LI>
</UL>

<P><B>Group 3 (Chair - <A HREF="mailto:gpotter@llnl.gov">Potter</A>):</B>
Regional climate models already include (for better or worse) surface-atmosphere
interaction. Horizontal transport of surface water is needed to close the
regional hydrologic cycle. Such upstream water is important for including
wetlands in a model. It is also important to include human influences such
as landscape changes and imported water (e.g., irrigation water drawn from
underground). In this regard, one needs to know if the model's surface
sub-model can properly accommodate land-use changes. A model may also need
to represent sub-grid variability of fields such as land cover and precipitation.
Other desirable sub-models include: </P>

<OL>
<LI>Interactive vegetation models with growth that responds realistically
to stresses </LI>

<LI>Interactive water-body models (e.g., lake, coastal zone models) </LI>

<LI>More realistic cloud-radiation models </LI>

<LI>Chemistry models (though potentially very expensive) </LI>
</OL>

<P>On the last point, it was recognized that some aspects of chemistry,
such as sulfur/aerosol modeling, may be more directly relevant to regional
simulation (i.e., more directly interactive) than others such as carbon-cycle
modeling. Before any addition, one should ask, &quot;Will it make a difference
in the regional climate simulation?&quot; Off-line sensitivity study can
help answer this question. </P>

<P><B>Group 2 (Chair - <A HREF="mailto:lettenma@ce.washington.edu">Lettenmaier</A>):</B>
The group assumed that all models include a representation of the land
surface and ocean reflecting the current state of the art. There needs
to be strong justification for including additional processes. In particular,
one must justify the added complexity. Off-line testing as in Project for
Intercomparison of Land-Surface Parameterization Schemes (PILPS) should
be done prior to implementing new routines in the model, followed by testing
with the newly coupled system. Candidate sub-models for inclusion in regional
models are </P>

<OL>

<LI>Atmospheric chemistry </LI>

<LI>Improved land-surface hydrology (this is already underway). </LI>

<P>The group noted that land-use sensitivity changes may be done more reliably
than integrated impacts assessment, since such a study involves altering
boundary conditions with reasonably well understood changes. Although local
changes in land are probably insignificant on GCM (global) scales, on regional
scales, they can produce results as large as the 2xCO2 signal.</P>

<P> <B>Group 1 (Chair - <A HREF="mailto:charles.vorosmarty@unh.edu">Vorosmarty</A>):</B>
There are several immediate internal improvements that can be made, involving
orographic effects, land use specification (urban vs non-urban, scenario
formulation), and water vapor in the atmosphere. Assuming long-term (30-year)
runs at 50 km resolution, there are several issues of importance to hydrology,
ecology, agriculture, and human health: </P>

<OL>
<LI>Heterogeneity, such as sub-grid variability of slopes, soils and vegetation.
This issue affects runoff production. </LI>

<LI>Horizontal routing of surface water, which is important for source/sink
connections involving wetlands and oceans. </LI>

<LI>Water engineering (e.g., reservoirs and draining or restoration of
wetlands) </LI>

<LI>Time variations in vegetation/ecosystems. Sub-models would include
phenology, crop growth, and leaf-area index (LAI) and rooting-depth changes.
Important seasonal, interannual, and interdecadal scales can be distinguished.
</LI>

<LI>Biogeochemistry </LI>

<LI>Snow/snowmelt dynamics </LI>

<LI>Atmospheric chemistry/aerosols, where there are several sub-issues:
</LI>

<UL>
<LI>mineral aerosol (dust) </LI>

<LI>sulfur cycling </LI>

<LI>NOx transformation to ozone and nitrogen loading </LI>

<LI>ozone </LI>

<LI>particulates (soot) </LI>

<LI>dry/wet deposition </LI>

<LI>indirect effects of aerosols on cloud structure and dynamics </LI>
</UL>

<LI>Oceans/sea-ice/lake models </LI>
</OL>

<P>The group felt that chemistry modeling involves the greatest additional
computational burden, followed by ocean/sea-ice modeling. Modeling ecosystems
and heterogeneity of surface features probably involves small additional
burden. In principle, there are few impediments to improvements, but in
practice, there are multiple purposes and agendas driving model changes.
An integration of goals could improve the efficiency of model improvement.

<H2>Session 3. Friday Morning 6 December 1996</H2>

<H2>PRESENTATION:</H2>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>NCEP Mesoscale Climate Simulations: Recent and Planned</H3>

<CENTER><P><A HREF="mailto:shong@sun1.wwb.noaa.gov">Song-You Hong<BR>
</A>NCEP</P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P> Song-You Hong of the National Centers for Environmental Prediction
(NCEP) gave an overview of the NCEP suite of global and regional models.
At the global scale, the global spectral model is used for weather and
climate predictions, and at the regional scale, the ETA and regional spectral
model (RSM) are available for both short term prediction and climate studies.
Coupling to ocean models at the global and regional scales are future extensions,
as is addition of a runoff model at the regional scale. </P></CENTER>

<P>From the results of simulations with the ETA model and RSM for July
of 1988 and 1993 over United States, which were dry and wet summers over
the middle U. S., respectively, both models were capable of reproducing
the observed precipitation patterns as well as synoptic patterns associated
with dry and wet summers over the Great Plains. However, in both years,
the ETA produced too little rain with a cold bias while RSM showed too
much rain. </P>

<P>It was emphasized that a recent improvement in the performance of the
RSM was achieved by overcoming regional mass conservation problems arising
from a mismatch in model terrain heights between the coarser, parent global
model and the embedded regional model in mountainous areas near the lateral
boundaries. The problem was overcome by employing an orography blending
technique between the regional model and the global model. </P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Planned Mesoscale Climate Simulations for TAR Impacts
Assessments</H3>

S. Takle</A>, and <A HREF="mailto:rwarritt@iastate.edu">R. W. Arritt<BR>
</A>Iowa State University </P></CENTER>

<P>Bill Gutowski of Iowa State University presented an overview of plans
for regional climate simulations for the IPCC Third Assessment Report (TAR)
and shorter term simulations under the PIRCS community intercomparison
experiments. Discussion ensued on specifics of simulations for the TAR.
A question was raised about the possibility of using new emission scenarios.
The consensus seemed to be that they would not be ready in time for global
models to use and produce results suitable as boundary conditions for regional
models. There is a school of thought that asserts that once regional effects
are determined for one scenario, regional effects for other scenarios will
scale with global effects. If results are available from simple (1-D) global
models that might permit scaling of previous results, then effects of new
emission scenarios might be incorporated into regional models. It is possible
that by the time baseline verification runs are done with regional models,
some results might be available from global simulations with effects of
aerosols included. Although the region of focus for the planned simulations
is the continental US where sulfate effects are primarily limited to the
eastern region, it was pointed out that regional effects may be ubiquitous
due to perturbations of the global flow fields. </P>

<P>The UKMO has produced global results with aerosols incorporated, but
only insofar as the albedo is affected. MPI is making new global simulations
that take into account the effects of aerosol being advected to other regions.
The IS92a (1% per year increase in CO2 emissions) scenario is being used
for these simulations. </P>

<P>A brief discussion was held on the PIRCS standard datasets. Encouragement
was expressed to include cloudiness in the dataset. </P>

<P>Discussions on the length of simulations led to the conclusion that
3 or even 5 year simulations would leave analysts apologizing about weak
statistics. Extension to 10 years would make a major difference. For hydrological
considerations, 30 years in almost essential to be able to see sequences
of floods and droughts. Running at lower resolution than 50 km in order
to get a longer period was generally discouraged because key mesoscale
processes become smeared out rapidly at scales larger than 50 km. The length
of the run also is influenced by the spin-up time on soil moisture, which
some estimate to be a year or more. It is important to separate model bias
from spin-up, however. </P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Future Emissions Scenarios</H3>

<CENTER><P><A HREF="mailto:schimel@ucar.edu">David Schimel<BR>
</A>NCAR/CGD<BR>
</P></CENTER>

<P>Dave Schimel discussed the need for simulations that use scenarios leading
to stabilization (as called for by the terms of reference of the Climate
Convention) rather than unbounded increases of greenhouse gases. The second
issue raised by Schimel was the need to consider the effects of aerosol.
Present sulfur emissions are about 75 Tg/yr, but would go down if all nations
adopt US, Canadian, and European standards. Direct and indirect effects
need to be incorporated. The best situation would be to have simulations
with two stabilizations, say at 550 and 750 ppm CO2, both with aerosol
included. Some IPCC advisors are urging that the full report be replaced
by a couple of interim reports. There seems to be no interest within the
policy community in having reports that extend projections beyond 2050.
Negotiators are very uncomfortable with agreements on stabilization at
750 ppm or above CO2. Mention was made of the paper in Science by Sarmiento
and Le Quere entitled <A HREF="http://www.sciencemag.org/science/scripts/display/full/274/5291/1346.html">Oceanic
carbon dioxide uptake in a model of century-scale global warming</A>.</P>

<P> Current results do not consider the impacts of several feedbacks on
atmospheric concentrations of CO2: effects from the biosphere are estimated
to be 15%. Feedback effects due to landuse and ocean are unknown but expected
to be large. In the case of ocean effects, for instance, the thermohaline
changes may cut off ocean uptake with the result that an apriori assumed
550 ppm CO2 stabilization level might actually produce a 650 ppm stabilization
due to ocean responses.</P>

<H2>PANEL OF MODELERS: B. Kuo (NCAR/MMM). F. Giorgi (NCAR/CGD), S.-Y. Hong
(NCEP), and B. Machenhaurer (MPI)</H2>

<P>A panel of modelers discussed the details of regional climate simulation.
One problem with the NCAR RegCM is that it produces too many small precipitation
events. There is a need to develop a standard procedure for estimating
the temperature. There generally is more confidence in the quality of monthly
mean temperatures than in daily values. If users of regional model output
know how the values were calculated, they have ways of creating subgrid
distributions.</P>

<P> It seems that overprediction (values too large) of winds is characteristic
of several models. There is a need to provide an overview of how good a
model is. A resolution of 50 km does not give extreme rainfall but does
simulate storm tracks reasonably well. Kuo suggested that another idea
is to simulate a smaller region at very high (perhaps 2 km) resolution
for a short period of time to examine some statistical properties from
mesoscale models. </P>

<P>Hong emphasized the need to understand systematic errors and that statistical
methods could be then used to reduce error for use in follow-on studies.
The assertion was made that effects due to climate change are small compared
to changes due to model biases. There was discussion on the possibility
of focusing more on the changes than absolute values. Some thought should
be given to saving variances at lower frequency rather than mean values
at high frequency. Machenhauer pointed out that 0.5 degree observations
give an underestimate of precipitation in general and snowfall in particular.
High Resolution Hamburg Model (HIRHAM) uses subgrid orography to improve
precipitation simulations. From the MPI experience, if the basic values
of temperature and precipitation are bad, there is little incentive to
have much confidence in humidity, wind, or radiation. Mearns pointed out
that it is important to document how the verification was made. Potter
encouraged that analysts make an intensive search for common, systematic
errors in all models. Giorgi re-asserted that errors in the implementation
of boundary conditions need to be separated from errors generated by the
models. </P>

<P>Mearns observed that humidity values near the surface produced by the
NCAR RegCM were surprisingly good, certainly much better than winds. Discussion
concluded that relative humidity might be easier to predict. Changes in
relative humidity due to climate change were observed to be small, and
the group viewed this as something that might be expected. </P>

<P>Different methods were discussed, both internal and external, for improving
the calculation of near-surface winds, which generally are predicted to
be too strong. The PIRCS list of archive variables again was discussed,
with encouragement to include clouds, perhaps high, middle and low. </P>

<P>The model verification phase (models driven by analyses) should precede
any simulations with regional models driven by GCMs. One procedure is to
examine ten Januarys and ten Julys. Encouragement was expressed to include
Aprils and Octobers, but it was noted that sequences of single months do
not capture seasonal transition effects. A question about soil moisture
for such a verification went unanswered. B. Bass noted that 1994 data from
the Oklahoma Mesonet and ARM CART site would be available soon for use
in verification studies. Encouragement was expressed to use the NCEP data
instead of single station values. F. Giorgi indicated the RegCM consumed
about 180 hours of YMP time for a one-year simulation. C. Hakkarinen noted
that the new C90 test period would permit large blocks of time to be requested,
and that it might be possible to get as much as 30,000 equivalent YMP hours
for a community experiment.</P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Coupling Mesoscale Climate Simulation</H3>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>and</H4>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Climate-Change Impact Assessments</H3>

<P>Atmospheric mesoscale models are useful tools for studying and forecasting
the behavior of the atmosphere over several days. In recent years, scientists
have begun applying these models to regional climate (continental scale
or smaller) in simulations lasting several weeks to several months. These
models can simulate climate for a region at resolutions higher than global
models are likely to attain routinely in the foreseeable future. This feature
makes them desirable tools for providing output on regional climate variability
that can be used for climate impact assessment, because natural and human
impacts of climate change are typically felt on the regional scales. Mesoscale
models are thus complementary tools to global climate models.</P>

<P> There are several challenges, however, posed by using mesoscale model
output to assess regional climate-change impacts. Satisfying all of these
challenges will require increased communication between mesoscale climate-modelers
and impacts assessors. We categorize this communication into three modes
of interaction. Rapid improvement of regional climate-change assessments
will require concurrent activity in all three modes.</P>

<P> In <I>Mode One</I>, the physical climate simulated by a mesoscale model
provides input into impact assessment models such as agricultural, water-resources
or human-health models. This is the most direct and immediate use of mesoscale
climate simulation. Numerous examples exist of Mode One assessments using
global models, which can guide mesoscale-model applications. However, a
number of issues still need to be resolved, which can be summarized in
part by a series of questions: </P>

<UL>
<LI>What mesoscale model output must be archived for impacts assessment?
</LI>

<LI>How frequently should the model simulation be sampled? </LI>

<LI>What cumulative output must be archived? </LI>

<LI>What are the error estimates for the model output? </LI>

<LI>How much do these errors contaminate the impact assessments? </LI>

<LI>Are there assessments that can not be done at the current state-of-the-science
modeling? </LI>

<LI>Should known biases in model output be adjusted, even though this may
upset the physical consistency of the output? </LI>
</UL>

<P>These issues involve challenges to both the modelers and the impact
assessors. Modelers will likely have to expand the list of output they
routinely archive, which increases data storage requirements and potentially
slows model integration through increased I/O. Modelers may also have to
build additional diagnostic codes into their models. Impact assessors will
need to determine how sensitive their assessment codes are to errors in
the input data derived from climate models.</P>

<P> In <I>Mode Two</I> , mesoscale modelers add new computations to their
model that are not fundamental to its simulation of climate, but desirable
for impact assessment. Mode Two is a continuation of an ongoing trend wherein
climate models have progressively internalized more and more earth-system
processes. Recent examples include simplified representations of soil and
ecosystem dynamics. These processes may be used in Mode One in external,
post-processing modules driven by mesoscale-model output, whereas in the
second mode, they are coupled directly into the simulation. Important questions
for Mode Two include </P>

<UL>
<LI>What are the next candidates for internalization? </LI>

<LI>Are there specific input needs for a process module that are best satisfied
by direct coupling? </LI>

<LI>What new, potentially significant feedbacks are introduced? </LI>

<LI>What are the impediments to direct coupling of a process? </LI>

<LI>What is the computational burden of internalizing a process? Does internalizing
allow one to obtain an impact assessment more efficiently? </LI>

<LI>What other costs and advantages are there to direct coupling? </LI>
</UL>

<P>This mode requires articulation by impacts assessors of what impact-assessment
models are capable of coupling directly into a mesoscale model. It also
requires modelers to articulate their simulation capabilities, such as
what fields are routinely computed within the model even if not saved in
output archives.</P>

<P> In <I>Mode Three</I>, impact assessors upgrade their models in response
to new types of driving data from mesoscale models that are not regularly
available from observations. For example, many agricultural models use
degree-days or daily minimum and maximum temperatures as input, partly
because that information is recorded and archived. However, plant development
involves temperature-sensitive processes during both day and night. Routine
observations of temperature fluctuations during the diurnal cycle are not
often available at mesoscale resolution, but a model can provide them almost
on a minute-by-minute scale. Relevant questions for Mode Three include
</P>

<UL>
<LI>What is the potential for improving impacts assessment models (when
given more comprehensive information about the physical environment)? </LI>

<LI>Are there clear research paths for producing timely improvements? </LI>

<LI>What is gained? </LI>

<LI>What additional demands do such improvements make on mesoscale models
and model archives? </LI>
</UL>

<P>Mode Three can be viewed in part as a step that must be taken for a
process before internalizing it in a model. However, it also poses a challenge
to impact assessors that routine observations do not. It requires them
to determine more carefully the sensitivity of their target processes to
temporal fluctuations and whether or not their modeling could be improved
with input data of much higher frequency or of a different type than routinely
observed.</P>
