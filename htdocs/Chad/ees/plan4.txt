weather and climate Specific issues that can be addressed with such models include local and regional transport of air poll~ltants, insects, or pesticides; short-term weather forecasting; severe weather warnings; flood forecasting; water resource management; soil erosion control; and transportation advisolies OUtp.lt from these models can be used to drive hydrological cycle models, biophysical models such as are used for crop growth and yield or forest succession models. S~lch meteorological models also can be used to interpolate, in a physically consistellt way, meteorological measurements from widely spaced observation stations to create an "enhanced climatology" for a region or country The resulting dataset will provide a comprehensive climatology at arbitrarily fine resolution as a basis for refining agronomic practices and cropping patterns and evalllating the s~lstainability of alternative strategies Local meteorologists working in partnership with atnlospheric modelers from the IITAP consortium institutions could run models and create or access datasets at Iowa State either in residence or remotely over the lnternet S~lch modeling and datasets will be the basis for follow-on studies on climate change and climate forecasting
