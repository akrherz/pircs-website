<h2>Environmental and Earth Sciences</h2>




Overview

      Environmental issues now have joined military and economic issues on the international political priority list. But of these three areas, environmental issues offer means of fostering, rather than inhibiting, international cooperation and collaboration, particularly in the area of scientific investigation. Environmental degradation not only jeopardizes aesthetics of our surroundings but threatens our access to clean air, adequate supplies of clean water, and sufficient production of healthful and nutritious food. Solutions to environmental problems bring practical benefits closely related to basic human needs.

      Addressing global problems in the environmental and earth sciences through IITAP offers opportunities to bring the latest tools of scientific inquiry to bear on basic and applied problems through international collaboration. This Thrust Area will focus attention on developing countries to:
      * foster excellence in science
      * generate local science infrastructure
      * develop partnerships with our scientific colleagues
      * ~dtlre~ e.~l need~



                                   Fostering excellence

      Approaching environmental problems from a physical science perspective through IITAP offers opportunities to apply basic conservation principles (mass, energy, and momentum) and to use advanced technical tools on meteorological, geophysical, biophysical, biogeochemical, and ecological problems. This approach gives a unique perspective distinct from most existing research programs in environmental science, in that modern global-change research (global climate change and variability, biodiversity, biogeochemical cycles, water-resource depletion and degradation, ozone depletion, energy consumption, renewable resources, sustainable agriculture, deforestation, sea-level rise, etc.) requires scientific information from many if not all nations to be comprehensive. Indigenous knowledge of local vegetation, landforms, geology, climate, and agriculture provides key datasets and case studies for testing models and establishing general results.
