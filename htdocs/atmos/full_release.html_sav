<a name="intro"><b><h2>1 - Introduction</h2></b></a>

Full participation in PIRCS simulations requires you to
register your model. 
Please fill out the registration form at the 
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.pircs.iastate.edu">PIRCS ftp site</a> (directory: /pub/PIRCS)
and send it to us. Please contact us if any question arises.
<p>

The full two-month boundary and initial conditions 
for experiment 1a can also be picked up from the
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.pircs.iastate.edu">PIRCS ftp site</a> (directory:
/pub/PIRCS/1988).
The full dataset is in the same format as the betatest
except for a slight change in boundary condition (BC) files. 
<p>
  
Experiment 1a covers the period from 0000 UTC May 15 to
0000 UTC July 15, 1988 and experiment 1b  
covers that from
0000 UTC June 1 to 0000  UTC July 31, 1993. The initial conditions
 for the atmosphere is at the commencement time while that for the 
sea-lake-surface temperature and soil moisture are the 
monthly averages. (See betatest for details.)
As in the betatest, this full dataset consists of data
themselves and sample reading routines. 

Please fill out the registration form (/PIRCS/FULL.RELEASE/registration_form)
and send it to us. Please contact us if any question arises.

Under /pub/PIRCS/1988 are four dirctories. One (UTIL.CODE) contains
sample reading and plotting codes. Three are data directories for different
proections of the PIRCS domain:<p>

<h3>UTIL.CODE directory</h3>

There are two subdirectories under the READ.CODE directory:<br>
<ul>
PS60Km -- for 60km polar-stereographic domain<br>
REG05d -- for 0.5x0.5 lat/lon domain <br>
GLB25d -- for 2.5x2.5 lat/lon global domain<br>
</ul>
Each contains some example reading and plotting routines.


<a name="datpk"><b><h2>3 - DATA PACKING</h2></b></a>

<p><b>Users of the <a href="./pircsex1.html">PIRCS Experiment 1</a> dataset
should be
aware that
the provided variables are not stagggered, i.e., they
are all
at the same location.</b> Because participant
models may use staggered grids horizontally 
the width of the forcing zone will differ between
models.
For example, for the Arakawa B grid, the width for T
and q will
be 8 grid spacings, but 9 for U and V.<p>
 

It is up to the participant to determine
which 
PIRCS dataset suits their needs best. 
It is recommended that participants use a bilinear
interpolation method
to interpolate the PIRCS grid-point data to their own
model's grid.
A bilinear interpolation subroutine based on
<i>bint.f</i> (described in 
Manning and Haagenson, 1992) is part of program
<i>indat_gen.f</i> included
in the distributed dataset.
Various programs that read the files containing the
data are available.
Hopefully these programs are designed
so that they can be easily adapted by the participants
in their efforts
to convert the LBC's to their specific model
configuration.
These codes are in <i/pub/PIRCS/1988/UTIL.CODE/IN_DATA</i> at the FTP site. 

<p>The data are packed in integer format, and are in
slices ('horizontal') of constant pressure. 
(25 mb being first, 1050 being last.) The data are
ordered as follows: surface pressure (Variable
code 001; units Pa), temperature (011; K), specific
humidity (051; kg/kg), u component of the
wind (033; m/s), and the v component of the wind (034;
m/s).  This code "unpacks" the data, as they are
stored in a positive integer format; i.e., for each
field (horizontal slice) a maximum value
is determined, and this (and every other data point) is
multiplied by some scale factor to ensure
that the desired number of significant digits are to
the left of the decimal point.  The
original data are extracted by subtracting the stored
data from the base value
and then dividing by
the scale factor.  The
space requirements are minimized through the storage of
data as positive integers.  To further
minimize the space requirements, data were compacted
using the standard UNIX "compress" (a
modified Lempel-Ziv algorithm popularized in Welch,
1984) command.  While this choice of
packing procedure is not a meteorological "standard"
like GRIB or BUFR, we think that fewer
problems will be experienced in the short term. 

<p> For each 'horizontal' slice the data are ordered as
follows, as you look at it on the screen
(Note, this applies for the ordering of the forcing
data as well.) <p>
<center>
<table>
<tr><td>SW Corner</td><td>(1,1) .......................................... (XMAX,1)</td><td>SE Corner</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>(1,2) .......................................... (XMAX,2)</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td> .............................. (I,J) ...................................</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td> ...........................................................................</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>NW corner</td><td>(1,YMAX) ...................... (XMAX,YMAX)</td><td>NE Corner</td></tr>
</table>
</center>
<p>
Note, in the read program, the I index is E-W, and the
J index is N-S.
