<h3>Overview</h3>

      Environmental issues now have joined military and economic issues
on the international political priority list. But of these three areas,
environmental issues offer means of fostering, rather than inhibiting,
international cooperation and collaboration, particularly in the area of
scientific investigation. Environmental degradation not only jeopardizes
aesthetics of our surroundings but threatens our access to clean air,
adequate supplies of clean water, and sufficient production of healthful
and nutritious food. Solutions to environmental problems bring practical
benefits closely related to basic human needs.<p>


      Addressing global problems in the environmental and earth sciences
through IITAP offers opportunities to bring the latest tools of
scientific inquiry to bear on basic and applied problems through
international collaboration. This Thrust Area will focus attention on
developing countries to:<p>

	<ul>
	<li>foster excellence in science
      <li> generate local science infrastructure
      <li> develop partnerships with our scientific colleagues
      <li> address local needs

</ul>

<center><h2>Fostering excellence</h2></center>

      Approaching environmental problems from a physical science
perspective through IITAP offers opportunities to apply basic
conservation principles (mass, energy, and momentum) and to use advanced
technical tools on meteorological, geophysical, biophysical,
biogeochemical, and ecological problems. This approach gives a unique
perspective distinct from most existing research programs in
environmental science, in that modern global-change research (global
climate change and variability, biodiversity, biogeochemical cycles,
water-resource depletion and degradation, ozone depletion, energy
consumption, renewable resources, sustainable agriculture,
deforestation, sea-level rise, etc.) requires scientific information
from many if not all nations to be comprehensive. Indigenous knowledge
of local vegetation, landforms, geology, climate, and agriculture
provides key datasets and case studies for testing models and
establishing general results.<p>


<i>      One of many examples of physical sciences being brought to bear on
environmental research is understanding the nature of turbulent flow
through an agricultural shelterbelt consisting of a line of trees or
shrubs. The process of turbulence production, transport and dissipation
within and in the lee of a living, aeroelastic barrier is a non-linear
problem in basic fluids that is not well understood but that lends
itself to numerical simulation, physical (laboratory) simulation and
field studies. Success, even partial success, in understanding this
problem will lead to better design of shelterbelts for modifying the
microclimate (e.g., reducing windspeed, decreasing evapotranspiration,
modifying temperature, enhancing downward transport of CO2 into the
crop) for sustaining and improving agricultural production.</i><p>


      Recent advances in the procedures and computational platforms for
numerical simulation and declines in hardware costs have brought
computer modeling of environmental systems within reach of scientists
and public managers in developing countries. Lack of local human
resources is the primary limitation to realizing more widespread use of
such advanced technologies in these countries. Workshops and
individualized scientific collaboration through IITAP will facilitate
the development of human resources for developing countries.<p>

<center><h2>Building partnerships</h2></center>

      IITAP, through environmental and earth sciences, will have unique
opportunities for linkages with scientists from developing countries.
Each country or region of the globe has distinct uniqueness in
meteorology, geology, climate, soils, and biophysical ecology. Many of
these unique features could or should be topics for scientific study in
a world that seeks to be more environmentally responsible and a
scientific community that seeks a broader expression of natural
diversity. International research programs on environmental problems in
developing countries bring scientists who have detailed knowledge of
their home regions, to the research table on equal basis with scientists
from developed countries, who may have access to more sophisticated
tools for inquiry. Environmental and earth sciences readily lend
themselves to field projects in both developed and developing countries
for individual investigation and for comparative analysis. Collaborative
research that brings together new technology with local environmental
expertise leads to mutually dependent partnerships.<p>


 <i>     Contamination of groundwater and surface water is an example of an
environmental problem shared by all countries but one that is
particularly acute in developing countries. Computer simulation of
contaminant plumes and modeling their migration in groundwater are
well-established technologies in the US. However, geological
environments and their control of contaminant migration are unique to
each country and are largely unknown. A partnership consisting of local
geologists and hydrogeologists and their counterparts at lowa State and
its consortium institutions would bring together the expertise to create
and describe the 3D representations of geological structures,
stratigraphic units, and facies and to contribute to our general
understanding of fluid movement in heterogeneous geological
environments.</i><p>

<center><h2>Generating local scientific infrastructure</h2></center>

      Environmental and earth sciences are by nature multidisciplinary.
By being closely positioned to practical applications, earth alld
environmental sciences offer rich opportunities to solve significant
humanitarian problems local to developing countries, which provides
incentives for scientists of these countries to remain at home.
Scientific respect and prestige are accrued by environmental scientists
from developing countries who participate in international collaboration
because of the local perspective and data they bring to the
collaboration. This respect and prestige will more likely be maintained
if they retain their linkage to their home colleagues and research
domain.<p>


      Solutions to local environmental problems in developing
countries through international collaboration will be noticed by local
policy makers who may, in turn, be more disposed to invest in local
science infrastructure. These policy makers, who may harbor suspicions
about unilateral foreign involvement in researching their environment,
would likely welcome opportunities to take charge of their own
environmental management through support for their own scientists.<p>

<center><h2>Addressing local needs</h2></center>
     Developing countries have urgent need for both basic and applied
research, but may not have the luxury of assembling large institutes for
the purpose of pure and basic research. The environmental and earth
sciences, as applied to such problems as groundwater contamination,
offer opportunities for basic theoretical and laboratory studies in
classical physics, chemistry, geophysics, and related areas which at the
same time offer applications that contribute more immediately to
national needs. Techniques used in developing countries for marginal
economic benefit, such as the use of agricultural shelterbelts, will
have a much more significant application in Sub Saharan Africa, where it
is used to reclaim productive land from the desert margin and contribute
to local food self sufficiency.<p>


      Another example of applying physically based principles to local
needs is the use of regional-scale meteorological modeling for
addressing local problems relating to weather and climate Specific
issues that can be addressed with such models include local and regional
transport of air pollutants, insects, or pesticides; short-term weather
forecasting; severe weather warnings; flood forecasting; water resource
management; soil erosion control; and transportation advisories Output
from these models can be used to drive hydrological cycle models,
biophysical models such as are used for crop growth and yield or forest
succession models. Such meteorological models also can be used to
interpolate, in a physically consistent way, meteorological
measurements from widely spaced observation stations to create an
"enhanced climatology" for a region or country The resulting dataset
will provide a comprehensive climatology at arbitrarily fine resolution
as a basis for refining agronomic practices and cropping patterns and
evaluating the sustainability of alternative strategies Local
meteorologists working in partnership with atmospheric modelers from
the IITAP consortium institutions could run models and create or access
datasets at Iowa State either in residence or remotely over the lnternet
Such modeling and datasets will be the basis for follow-on studies on
climate change and climate forecasting.<p>
