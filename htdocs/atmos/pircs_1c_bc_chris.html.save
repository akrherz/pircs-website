<a name="intro"><b><h2>1 - Introduction</h2></b></a>

PIRCS experiment 1(c) consists of a minimum of 7.5 years of integration, 1986 July 1 through
1993 December 31 (past PIRCS participants have recommended extending simulations
to 1999 December 31), with the first 6 months as spinup.  The minimum period overlaps
the monsoon experiments SWAMP-90, SWAMP-93, and EMVER-93 and the Midwest drought
of 1988 and flood of 1993. 
Model domains should fall within the region 145.0 W -55.0 W and 5.0 
N - 60.0 N, for which we supply NCEP/DOE Reanalysis-2 (R-2) and Reynolds SST as driving data. 
This area includes both the forcing frame for lateral boundary 
conditions and the inner "free" domain that will be analyzed.  Models 
do not need to cover this entire region, as it has been chosen to 
ensure all models cover approximately the same inner region no matter 
what projection they use. In particular, modelers who participated in 
PIRCS 1(a) and 1(b) simulations are asked simply to move the southern boundary 
of their PIRCS domain 5 degrees to the south.  Although Reynolds SST is ingested
by R-2, we request that participants use Reynold's SST instead, because
higher spatial resolution is retained by doing so.
