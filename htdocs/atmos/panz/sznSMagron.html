<a name="intro"><b><h2>Introduction</h2></b></a>

As a test run of the Agroecosystem Water Management Model, we try to project soil water 
available to crops in Iowa during growing season. The ultimate goal of this Agronomy Endowment
funded project is to develope a fully coupled modeling system that will allow crop producers 
to inventory, update, and project seasonal soil water availability at field or 
sub-field scales for planning strategies on cropping, seed selection, 
chemical application, planting, harvest, and marketing, 
and allow scientists to further their understanding of 
nonlinear interactions among individual components within 
a whole agroecosystem. <p>  

This integrated model will eventually couple following component modules:<p>

<li> Regional climate model - MM5 <br>
<li> Crop growth and root development model <br>
<li> Soil and hydrological model <br>

The initial and boundary conditions were provided by 
the Experimental Climate Prediction Center 
<A HREF="http://ecpc.ucsd.edu/"> ECPC</a>. 
Integration stated from April 28 through August 25, 2001.
