I. Introduction
<ul>
<li>	A. Recent technological advances have permitted sophisticated 
	   meteorological models to be run on computer workstations
	   rather than supercomputers.
<p>
<li>	B. Availability of high-volume data storage, high-speed retrieval,
	   and global communication systems makes data more widely
	   accessible for research and operational applications.
<p>
<li>	C. Potential exists for "model-enhancement" of agroclimatic
	   databases
<p>
<li>	D. Opportunities exist for training scientists from the international
	   community, particularly scientists from developing countries,
	   in the use of these models for agroclimatic applications.
