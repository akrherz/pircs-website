<h2>Overview of IITAP/EES given by Dr. Gene Takle during the visit of Dr.
Federico Mayor, Director-General of UNESCO, to the
Intercomparison Workshop, November 17, 1994</h2>

Dr. Mayor, I would like you to meet Dr. Richard Anthes, President
of the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research and
Keynote speaker for our workshop.  In addition to his duties as
administrator of UCAR, Dr. Anthes is widely recognized as the
dean of regional scale atmospheric modeling.
<p>
This workshop is one of a number of activities planned for
IITAP's Thrust Area in Environmental and Earth Sciences, and it
is typical of the activities we envision for this area of IITAP,
because it offers an opportunity to apply basic physical science
principles to the study of environmental problems that are common
to both developed and developing countries.
<p>
We feel that the environmental sciences offer unique
opportunities for IITAP to promote science infrastructure in
developing countries.  Access to clean air, safe drinking water,
and an adequate supply of nutritious food are goals of both
developed and developing countries.  Environmental modeling, of
the kind practiced by scientists in this room, offers tools for
local policy makers to choose the more sustainable options for
achieving these goals during the process of economic development.
<p>
A second reason for pursuing the environmental sciences under
IITAP is that each country has unique climatic, geological,
geographical, and biopheric characteristics that are of interest
to scientists outside as well as inside these countries.  By
bringing his or her unique environmental datasets, scientists
from the developing countries come as equal partners to the
international collaboration and thereby will be motivated to
retain ties to their native lands and sources of data.
<p>
We have assembled in this room representatives of a cross-section
of the major regional climate modeling research groups in the
world.  Our purpose is to design a model intercomparison project
that will help us evaluate these models and produce new ones.  We
have some scientists from developing countries at this meeting,
and it is our intent to engage many more such people when the
project is underway so that they can learn the modeling process
by active participation. 
<p>
The models used by many people in this room are more
computationally demanding than even global climate models.  This
fact has limited their operational platforms to supercomputers -
that is,until very recently.  Powerful computer workstations now
can be used for these simulations, which potentially makes these
models accessible to scientists from developing countries.  As
computing power continues to advance, these developing-country
partners will become even more actively engaged in climate
modeling.<p>

Discussions I have had with some of our workshop participants
indicates to me that the IITAP motivation to engage scientists
from developing countries into our project adds urgency and
incentive to what we do.  We look forward to working with each
other, with scientists from developing countries, and with UNESCO
as our project gets underway.
<p>
We thank you for visiting our workshop, and we would like to help
answer any questions you may have about our work.<p>
