            each + 15 min questions.  What is the intent of a
                  mesoscale model?  What is it good for?  What
                        is it not good for?  What are opportunities for
                        climate modeling?  How does mesoscale-model
                                                climate simulation differ from global
                        simulation?  How does it differ from several-day
                        simulation?  What lessons can we apply from
                        past mesoscale-modeling experience?</td>

                        output fields to archive for impacts studies,
                        including types of diagnostic (but not
                        simulation) codes that may need to be embedded
                        in the model.
                                List should include frequency of
                        output, whether output is instantaneous or
                        cumulative.  Estimates of systematic and
                        random errors.  Error tolerance for impact
                        studies.  Discussion should include and report
                        on questions raised in preparatory white paper
                        and additional questions we might generate.</td>

                        the process subroutine) and what they should
                        return, either as model output or as feedbacks
                        to other model processes.  List should be
