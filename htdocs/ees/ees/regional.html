<h2>Regional-Scale Meteorological Modeling</h2>

     Weather and climate directly affect the economies of all nations through impact on
such areas as agricultural production, transportation, and water management.  Better
understanding of the physics governing weather and climate will enable developing countries
to reduce their exposure to weather-related risk and promote sustainable development.  Tools
to achieve these goals represent an active area of state-of-the-art research and can be
acquired at reasonable cost.  Fostering the use and development of these tools in the
international community would enable the IITAP to build scientific partnerships that engage
developing countries in current research while addressing national needs.

     Food production in all countries is limited by weather and climate.  Many developing
countries are particularly vulnerable because their climates are marginal for food production
or are highly variable in space, which requires highly pluralistic cropping practices to
achieve maximum total production.  In many cases, these developing countries could take
advantage of refined agronomic strategies (e.g., shelterbelts, strip cropping, intercropping,
response farming) if more refined spatial and temporal details were known about their
climates. Many of these countries currently have climatologies developed from records that
are too short, contain unacceptably large gaps, do not include data on all critical variables, or
that are derived from a limited set of stations that doesn't represent the spatial variability of
the country.

     Mesoscale meteorological models are fluid-flow models based on fundamental
conservation laws of physics.  They can allow resolution of basic weather variables down to
scales of a few kilometers or less.  If such a model has its boundary conditions supplied by
larger-scale (synoptic-scale) values of meteorological variables at regular space and time
intervals and with detailed surface orographic, land use, and soil characteristics, it can
simulate the complete set of meteorological variables at each point of a 3-D grid.  By the
processes of four-dimensional data assimilation,  the resulting meteorological fields produced
by the model are forced to agree with available observations and create physically consistent
values at intermediate points and times.  If this procedure is carried out over the period of
record for the domain (country or region), a very large 4-D dataset is created with arbitrarily
high spatial resolution.  Such a dataset can then be the basis for optimizing the selection of
crops and agronomic practices for specific subregions for enhancing production under
sustainable practices.  These meteorological models can be used for weather forecasting, air
pollution studies, monitoring insect migration, and many other applications

     We are planning a pilot study to demonstrate this method and are seeking names of
physical scientists from developing countries that would be interested in becoming research
partners in this venture.
