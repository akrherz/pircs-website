____________________________________________________________________

<b>HOURLY</b>
Average of data over the hour (e.g., output at 12 UTC is average
over period from 11 UTC - 12 UTC).

1. Surface fluxes  [all in W/m^2, except precipitation]
    (a) incident solar (shortwave) radiation
    (b) reflected solar (shortwave) radiation
    (c) upward terrestrial (longwave) radiation
    (d) downward terrestrial (longwave) radiation
    (e) sensible heat flux
    (f) deep-soil heat flux
    (g) latent heat flux (evapotranspiration)
    (h) precipitation [mm/month]

2.  Top-of-atmosphere fluxes  [all in W/m^2]
    (a) net solar (shortwave) radiation
    (b) upward terrestrial (longwave) radiation

3.  Mass
    (a) surface pressure  [Pa]
    (b) precipitable water  [m]

4.  Mixed-Layer Depth [m]
(defined to be the midpoint of the model layer closest to the surface
 for which the potential temperature change with height, d(theta)/dz,
 exceeds +1 K/km)

 
<b>DAILY</b>
1.  1.5 meter (screen height) temperature  [K]
    (a) Daily maximum and time of maximum (period:  6 UTC - 6 UTC)
    (b) Daily minimum and time of minimum (period:  6 UTC - 6 UTC)

2.  Soil moisture at 12 UTC for each layer of the soil model used

<b>5-DAY AVERAGE</b>
Output averaged over successive 5-day periods, yielding 12 periods
for the 60-day simulation.  Output should be interpolated to the
levels 1000 mb, 925 mb, 850 mb, 700 mb, 500 mb, 400  mb, 300 mb and
200 mb. Horizontal wind components should be the true east-west and
north-south components.

1. Temperature [K]
2. Specific humidity [kg/kg]
3. Zonal (east-west) wind [m/s]
4. Meridional (north-south) wind [m/s]
5. Geopotential height [m]
