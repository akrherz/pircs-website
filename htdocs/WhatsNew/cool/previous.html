                Application programmers should be aware that XFS recently relaxed
                the requirement that direct I/O be aligned along filesystem block
                boundaries. As of IRIX 6.5.19f, direct I/O will also be accepted
                using 512-byte alignment. This change makes the use of direct I/O on
                a CXFS partition more consistent with that of other vendors
                requirements and thus makes the use of CXFS more transparent. See
                the description of direct I/O requirements in the fcntl(2) man
                page.

                virtual point-in-time images of a filesystem without
                causing a service interruption. The snapshot feature

                limit accumulation and enforcement for the specified resource is
                being ignored.  This function can be used by sites
                to implement a site-specific solution for
                resource accumulation and enforcement.  Using this system
                call allows the various job limit status commands to
                display usage values as reported  from the site-specific
                implementation.  For more information, see the setjusage(2)

                Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) is the next generation Internet
                protocol, designed eventually to replace the current IPv4.
                IPv6 is expected to grow in usage gradually over many years and

                IPv4 uses a 32-bit address scheme to represent a unique Internet address
                while IPv6 uses a 128-bit addressing scheme.
                Because IPv6 has four times the number of bits to represent addresses,
                it provides several billion times the address space of IPv4 and adds
                an almost unlimited number of available IP addresses.
                This resolves a projected future
                shortage of IPv4 addresses as more and more devices are added to the
                Internet.

                To ease the transition from IPv4 based networks to IPv6, IRIX
                supports a dual-stack protocol implementation that supports both
                IPv4 and IPv6 protocols on the same system. The IPv6 basic socket API
                is supported and allows network programs to use either protocol.
                The IPv6 API software interface communicates transparently with both
                IPv4 and IPv6 nodes.
                It automatically chooses the right protocol to communicate with any
                particular node.
                It has an encapsulation mechanism called tunneling that allows IPv6
                packets to operate over IPv4 networks. The IPv6 protocol
                allows networking applications to operate transparently in both
                environments.

                The reboot_on_panic parameter, when set to 1, specifies
                that the system should automatically reboot after a
                kernel panic.  This is particularly useful for servers
                or other systems which frequently go unattended or
                are used remotely, where it may not be convenient to
                physically reset the system.  The
                default for SGI servers and large graphical systems
                is to reboot after a kernel panic.

                It is important to note that the rebound variable, an environment
                variable set in the PROM monitor for most processors,  is always checked
                before the reboot_on_panic parameter and can override it.
                If the reboot_on_panic parameter is set to 0 and the rebound value is
                set to y, the reboot_on_panic parameter in effect becomes

                to move processes between cpusets and optionally migrate their memory.

                or groups of processes, between existing cpusets,
                and out of a named cpuset into the pool of CPUs not

                XFS inode numbers are 64-bit values containing an
                encoded disk location. For large filesystems (1 Terabyte plus),
                the inode numbers can overflow into the top 32 bits
                of the number. Certain backup applications which
                use the inode number only allow 32 bits of space,
                and thus have severe problems dealing with very
                large XFS filesystems.
                <P>
                In IRIX 6.5.15, XFS was changed to allocate
                inodes only within the lower portion of the filesystem
                to avoid this overflow issue. Other allocation policies
                in the filesystem will make this lower order
                space preferred for inodes and reduce the risk of a
                filesystem refusing to create new inodes when it
                still has space available.
                <P>
                For existing large filesystems with high numbered inodes
                this does not solve the problem, but it does solve it
                for new filesystems, and for new files created on
                existing filesystems.
                <P>
                For backwards compatibility a new mount option
                is available, inode64, this will allow xfs to place
                inodes anywhere in the filesystem and
                follow exactly the original placement policies.
                Filesystems which were small enough not to be able
                to overflow 32 bits of inode number also
                retain the old behavior.

                The IRIX 6.5.15 release added a coremask parameter set in the
                /var/sysgen/mtune/kernel file to determine
                what kind of permissions a core file will receive.
                Currently, when a process creates a core file,
                it uses the umask of the owner of the process
                to determine the permissions.
                This can lead to core files containing sensitive information
                being created with world readable permissions.
                This systune variable allows the system administrator
                to limit access to core files.
                The default is 0, which is the current behavior.
                However, if the coremask variable is set to some other value,
                it uses that number as the umask and
                ignores the umask of the owner of the process.
                For example, if coremask is set to 0177 and the owner of the process
                has a umask of 022, the permissions set on the core file will be 600
                instead of 644.
                This variable assumes that the number entered is octal. The default
                setting is 0. The minimum setting is 0.
                The maximum setting is 0177.

                For the 6.5.15 release, the systune(1M) man page was
                updated to describe a situation where the system segment size
                value (syssegsz) reported by the systune command is different
                than the value set in the /unix file as follows:
                <P>
                The systune(1M) may not show the user-defined value of
                syssegsz after a system reboot.
                This is due to the fact that the colormap must be calculated
                and added to the syssegsz value for machine types IP19,
                IP20, IP22, and IP32.  When systune is called, it
                compares the value of syssegsz in the kernel to the
                value set in the /var/sysgen/stune file. If this
                is done on one of the above machines, the values
                will not match because syssegsz has been altered
                with the colormap value in the kernel, but not in
                the /var/sysgen/stune file.  This indicates normal functioning

                fsr_xfs(1M) command into the fsr(1M) command. With previous releases of 
                IRIX, the fsr command could be run only on EFS filesystems and the 
                fsr_xfs command could be run only on XFS filesystems. Both commands 
                reorganize filesystems so that the layout of the extents is improved. 
                This improves the performance of mounted filesystems that have become 
                fragmented over time. With this release, the fsr command invokes 
                fsr_xfs when it encounters XFS filesystems. With this change, the 
                default crontab(1M) entry that calls fsr, also reorganizes XFS 
                filesystems. For information on the fsr command and the fsr_xfs and

                events, changes in system hardware and software configuration, and 
                system performance) that can occur on their system. Embedded Support
