            family is to provide a high quality and stable operating system for all 
            SGI systems. This release family supports all SGI hardware platforms 
            supported by IRIX 6.2, 6.3, and 6.4, except for Crimson. Significant 
            additional software has been packaged with IRIX 6.5, including some

       In IRIX 6.5.22, the mkfs command supports a new version=ci
       suboption for the -n (naming) option.  Specifying this option
       enables a version 2 filesystem directory with case-insensitive
       filenames.  Filenames will be stored in directories
       as they were created, but all file or directory name searches
       will be case-insensitive.
       This feature is normally used only when the filesystem will be used by 
       Windows CXFS clients.

       A new mode has been added to IRIX's kernel NFS service where the number
       of NFS server daemons grows and shrinks in response to NFS load.
       Previously on IRIX this was a fixed number that the system
       administrator had to choose, and both the default number and the
       recommended tuning procedure ensured inadequate NFS performance for
       many workloads.  IRIX now requires less tuning and will perform better
       out of the box.

        NFS now provides an optional "async" mode to improve 
        write performance.  This mode is set with the
        async option of the exportfs command.
        By allowing an administrator to switch from synchronous write/commit
        cycles to performing the same operations asynchronously, NFS writes
        can finish up-to 10 times faster on the client and server can
        perform writes in the way which can optimize backend filesystem IO
        pattern.  This option is recommended only for heavy synchronous
        write loads.  For further information, see the exportfs(1M) man page.

       A an "offline" option to the exportfs command has been

       Historically Failsafe relied on brute-force approach to stop
       NFS-related activity by killing NFS daemons. With the "offline"
       option a selected subset of filesystem can be moved offline
       while NFS server can continue to serve requests to other
