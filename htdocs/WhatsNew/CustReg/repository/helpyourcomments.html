For questions 1 through 6, choose your answer by clicking on the appropriate 
button.

For the last two questions on the page, select the appropriate rating on a 
scale of 1 to 10 (10 being `excellent') by clicking on the pull down menus for 
each. If you want to change your selection, simply reselect your choice from the
pull down menus. If you cannot answer either of these two questions, select 
`Do Not Know' from the menus.
