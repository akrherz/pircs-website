            to install a patch.

            If you wish to do a live install and are running 6.5.19 or earlier, then

                6.5.13f or earlier version of CXFS is installed,
                you will need to upgrade to 
                the 6.5.14f or later version CXFS (sysadm_cxfs) and install 6.5.14f or
                later sysadm_cluster.</FONT><FONT FACE="helvetica"> </FONT>

                Misconfigured CXFS cluster can yield repeated ioconfig and xvm probe commands

                <P>
                <FONT FACE="helvetica">
                A misconfigured CXFS cluster can result in clconfd issuing repeated
                ioconfig and xvm probe commands.
                This may not be noticeable on multiprocessor
                machines, but a single processor machine may become unusable. If a CXFS
                filesystem is configured to be mounted on a CXFS node which does not
                have a physical connection to the underlying volume, clconfd detects
                the ability to access the volume and issues an ioconfig command followed by an
                xvm probe of all the disks in
                an attempt to rectify the problem. The frequency at which this process
                occurs is not correctly controlled, which results in high system resource usage.
                This issue is being
                tracked by SGI and will be resolved in a future release;
                support contract customers can contact their local support
                organization for more information on the status of this issue.
                <P>
                CXFS clusters which correctly configured filesystems will not encounter
                this issue.

                <FONT FACE="helvetica">
                For IRIX 6.5.17, a fix was implemented to ensure that
                sadc/sar will give a correct vswap value.  To enable
                the fix, reboot the system to the new kernel.  If you
                do not reboot the system, sadc/sar will continue to
                work, but vswap numbers may be inaccurate. 
                If the accuracy of the sadc/sar number is important,
                we recommend that you reboot as soon as possible
                after upgrading.
