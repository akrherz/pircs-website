                 <FONT FACE="helvetica">Similarly, if you are running a

                at the same time. For example, by following the instructions in the <I>IRIX 
                6.5 Installation Instructions</I> CD booklet, you can 
                upgrade directly from IRIX 6.2 to 6.5.22.</FONT><BR>

                 <FONT FACE="helvetica">If you are upgrading from a 
                pre-6.5 version of IRIX, then create a full system backup before 
                upgrading to a new operating system. If, for any reason, you need to 
                return to a previous operating system after the upgrade, you can use a 
                full system backup tape or filesystem to do so. If you are upgrading 
                from IRIX 6.5 or 6.5.x to IRIX 6.5.22, a full system backup is not 
                required, but we encourage you to back up your system fully during any 
                operating system installation or upgrade. Instructions for backing up 
                and restoring workstations can be found in the online <I>Personal 
                System Administration Guide</I>. For servers, use the 
                backup(1) and restore(1) commands; refer to the online book <I>IRIX
