We provide language and cultural support for two encodings of Chinese, 
a simplified encoding for the Chinese mainland and a traditional 
encoding for Taiwan. The large number of characters in the Chinese 
language makes it impossible to arrange them on a keyboard. Therefore, 
an input method, called the input server, is used to make sequences of 
keyboard events that correspond to each Chinese character. The input 
server for WorldView<FONT SIZE="-2">(TM)</FONT> Chinese is called <I>xwnmo(1)</I>. 
It translates your input of phonetic symbols into the equivalent 
character or characters and provides a list of choices when there is 
any ambiguity. <BR>

Printing</H3>
<P>
To print a Chinese language text file to a PostScript compatible 
printer, use the following command: </P>
<P>
<SAMP>% lpcns <I>textfile</I> | lp</SAMP> </P>
<P>
where <I>textfile</I> is the name of your file. The <I>lpcns</I>
 program converts Chinese text to PostScript format. You can print 
directly from <I>ieditor</I> if your printer supports Chinese 
characters. If a printer that supports Chinese characters is not 
available, you may save the document as a text file in <I>ieditor</I>
 or <I>Showcase</I> before printing it with the <I>lpcns</I> command. </P>
