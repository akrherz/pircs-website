Notes </H4>
<P>
The standard keyboard shipped with most SGI systems can 
enter only ASCII characters by default. Configured as shipped, it does 
not allow users to enter or use non-ASCII characters needed for Italian 
or certain other languages. However, the Italian location makes it 
possible to use non-ASCII characters with most system tools. </P>
<P>
The &quot;US ASCII with Compose key&quot; keyboard layout is exactly 
like the default layout for the (101-key) US keyboard, except that the 
right Alt key (the key immediately to the right of the space bar) acts 
as a Compose key, which makes it possible to enter many non-ASCII 
characters. See the <I>compose(5)</I> and <I>composetable(5)</I> man 
pages for more information about using the Compose key. </P>
<P>
Many systems sold in Italy may include a keyboard designed for the 
Italian language. If your system has a Italian language keyboard, you 
should choose the Italian keyboard selection from the Language Controls 
panel; this will make your keyboard generate the characters that appear 
on each key. The right Alt key on the Italian keyboard selects 
alternate characters for many of the keyboard keys. Pressing Shift and 
the right Alt key and then releasing both keys activates the <I>compose</I>
 function, as described in <I>compose(5)</I>, on the Italian keyboard. </P>
<P>
If you are not certain which keyboard you have, first look at the Enter 
key. If your Enter key is rectangular, you have a US keyboard and 
should use the &quot;US ASCII with Compose key&quot; keyboard layout. 
If your Enter key is non-rectangular, you probably have a Italian 
keyboard. </P>
<P>
If your keyboard has a non-rectangular Enter key, and selecting the 
Italian keyboard layout does not make it work properly, it is possible 
that you have a national keyboard for some other country. You can try 
each of the keyboard layouts listed in the Language Controls panel 
until you find the one that matches your layout, or contact your sales 
and support office for assistance. </P>
