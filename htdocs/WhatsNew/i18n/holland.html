Notes </P>
<P>
The standard keyboard shipped with most SGI systems can 
enter only ASCII characters by default. Configured as shipped, it does 
not allow Dutch users to enter or use non-ASCII characters needed for 
Dutch or other European languages. </P>
<P>
The Netherlands location makes it possible to use non-ASCII characters 
with most system tools. The US ASCII with Compose key keyboard layout 
is exactly like the default layout for the (101-key) US keyboard, 
except that the right Alt key (the key immediately to the right of the 
space bar) behaves as a Compose key, which makes it possible to enter 
many non-ASCII characters. See the <I>compose(5)</I> and <I>composetable(5)</I>
 man pages for more information about using the Compose key. </P>

questions please contact your local SGI representative. </P>
