We provide language and cultural support for several Asian languages, 
including Japanese. The large number of characters in the Japanese 
language makes it impossible to arrange them on a keyboard. Therefore, 
an input method, called the input server, is used to make sequences of 
keyboard events that correspond to each kanji character. The input 
server for WorldView<FONT SIZE="-2">(TM)</FONT> Japanese is called <I>xwnmo2.&nbsp;</I>
 It translates your input of phonetic symbols into the equivalent 
character or characters and provides a list of choices when there is 
any ambiguity. <BR>
