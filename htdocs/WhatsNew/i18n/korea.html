<P>
We provide language and cultural support for several Asian languages, 
including Korean. The large number of characters in the Korean language 
makes it impossible to arrange them on a keyboard. Therefore, an input 
method, called the input server, is used to make sequences of keyboard 
events that correspond to each Korean character. The input server for 
WorldView<FONT SIZE="1">(TM)</FONT> Korean is called <VAR>xwnmo(1)</VAR>. 
It translates your input of phonetic symbols into the equivalent 
character.</P>

Printing</H3>
<P>
To print a Korean language text file to a PostScript compatible 
printer, use the following command: </P>
<P>
<SAMP>% /bin/lp -dprinter </SAMP><EM>textfile</EM></P>
<P>
where <EM>textfile</EM> is the name of your file. If a PostScript 
printer does not support Korean characters, you should modify the <EM>/usr/lib/print/ilptops_map.ko_KR.euc</EM>
 file before printing with the <SAMP>lp</SAMP> command. For details, 
please see WorldView<FONT SIZE="1">(TM)</FONT> Korean Manual.</P>
