            Serving up web pages has never been so easy! Silicon Graphics

            O2 systems. The server automatically turns on when you power on your 
            system. All you need to do to publish your files on the Web is put them 
            in the public_html folder that you will find in your home directory 
            (for example, /usr/people/bob/public_html). The SGI web server based on 
            Apache is also configured to work with OutBox Personal Web Site, which 
            is pre-installed on most systems.</P>
            The SGI web server is an easy-to-use, powerful web server for creating
