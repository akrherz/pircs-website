Limited-area atmospheric numerical models have recently gained widespread 
use as tools for understanding regional climates.  This technique is also 
being explored as a method for evaluating regional climate change and its 
impacts on human activities.  This session will summarize recent progress 
and outstanding issues in the use of regional climate models.  For this 
purpose "climate" simulations are defined as having duration of at least 
30 days (i.e., beyond the range of deterministic weather prediction). 
Contributions are also invited on complementary modeling techniques, 
such as global variable-resolution models, and methods for processing 
and interpreting regional climate model results.
<P>
The regional climate modeling session is a part of a five-day
(19-23 July) program on model intercomparisons, which
will also include AMIP and other organized climate
model intercomparison projects.
The regional modeling session
is scheduled for

<P>
The quantity and quality of abstracts received 
point to an excellent session. The program for the model
intercomparison session (including the regional modeling 
session) is available on the PCMDI web site at

<P>
Presenters at the IUGG session are encouraged to submit followup
papers to a JGR special issue on regional climate modeling, which
will have a manuscript due date of <B>1 December 1999.</B>
Contributions to the JGR issue also
are welcome from those who are unable to attend
the IUGG session.
