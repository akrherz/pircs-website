    <p>We present preliminary results of six regional climate
    models participating in the Project to Intercompare
    Regional Climate Simulations (PIRCS). The goal of PIRCS is to
    advance the state of regional climate modeling by a series of
    systematic intercomparisons. PIRCS Experiment 1 includes
    simulations of the drought of 1988 and the regional flood
    of 1993 in the central U.S. </p>
    <p>Here we focus mainly on preliminary results for
    precipitation processes during the 1988 drought. Detailed
    analysis of precipitation is presented for a portion of the
    Upper Mississippi River basin that provides a contrast
    between 1988 and 1993, since it includes the peak
    precipitation area of the 1993 flood. The region also is
    relatively well resolved from the standpoint of a regional
    model but marginally resolved in terms of a GCM or the
    NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis. </p>
    <p>All of the models capture the lateral boundary forcing as
    indicated by the timing of precipitation episodes. Evaluation
    of model performance for different types of events gives a
    perspective on how the models handle different types of
    forcing (e.g., large-scale versus convective or mesoscale).
    The early part of the period was dominated by large-scale
    synoptic events; all models captured the timing of these. A
    subsequent dry period broken by a mesoscale convective system
    also was represented by all models. The models occasionally
    differ on whether precipitation is represented as convective
    or stratiform. During a two-week period of isolated
    convective events all models give convective precipitation
    dominating although timing did not always correspond exactly
    to observations. These results suggest that large-scale
    precipitation episodes are predicted deterministically by the
    models, with all models giving essentially similar results.
    Scattered convective precipitation is
    represented more statistically, with variation from model
    to model in the timing
    and geographical distribution of precipitation. </p>
    <p>Analyses are being conducted of specific precipitation
    processes in the models. Preliminary results indicate that
    the models are able to represent organized mesoscale
    convective systems. Specifically, the low-mid level cyclonic
    inflow and upper level cyclonic outflow that are
    characteristic of MCCs were found during precipitation
    episodes in several models. Comparison with wind profiler
    data indicates that the nocturnal low-level jet, which is the
    major environmental influence on summertime precipitation in
    the target region, is represented much more accurately in the
    regional models than in the NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis. Further
    diagnostics include equitable threat and bias scores for
    quantitative precipitation thresholds as compared with
    observations.</p>
