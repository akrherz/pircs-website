         <p class="content"><font class="content">As a test run of the Agroecosystem
         Water Management Model, we try to project soil water available to crops in 
         Iowa during growing the season. The ultimate goal of this project, funded by 
         an agronomy endowment of Iowa State University, is to develop a fully coupled
         modeling system that will allow crop producers to inventory, update, and project
         seasonal soil water availability at field or sub-field scales. The system will
         assist producers in planning strategies on cropping, seed selection, chemical 
         application, planting, harvest, marketing, and allow scientists to further their 
         understanding of nonlinear interactions among individual components within a 
         complete agroecosystem.</font></p>
         <p class="content"><font class="content">The lateral boundary conditions for our 
         regional model are obtained from the Experimental Climate Prediction Center (ECPC) 
         at the Scripps Institute of Oceanography which makes several global forecasts, 
         including the 16 week forecast used here. The ECPC's global atmospheric climate 
         prediction system is based on the National Centers for Environmental Prediction 
         (NCEP) global model with the T62L28 resolution (See <a href="http://ecpc.ucsd.edu">
         http://ecpc.ucsd.edu</a> for details).</font></p>
         <p class="content"><font class="content">
         This integrated model will eventually couple the following component modules:</font></p>
