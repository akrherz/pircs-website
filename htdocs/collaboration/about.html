<B>About BSCW</B></P>
<P>
The BSCW system supports collaboration by providing shared workspaces 
over the Internet. A shared workspace</P>
<P>
allows storage and retrieval of documents and sharing information 
within a group. This functionality is integrated</P>
<P>
with a simple event mechanism to provide each user with an awareness of 
the activities of others within the</P>
<P>
workspace. The system is designed primarily to support self-organising 
groups.</P>
