<font class="text">
Physically based modeling for the purpose of
understanding regional climate, climate change, and climate variability is
rapidly increasing in sophistication and usage.  Application of a variety
of models to a wide range of problems within and
beyond the developed countries suggests that interest in this technique
will likely continue to grow.  These applications go beyond simply modeling
the local weather for extended periods and aim at simulating the regional,
coupled system of land, atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere and biosphere
processes.  Accordingly, diagnosis of these models typically includes
monthly or longer period statistics of means, variances and extremes of
targeted fields.  These models have been and will continue to be focal
points for both theoretical and applied research.<p>

A useful approach for improving regional climate simulations
is the comparison of simulations produced by different models with
each other as well as with available observations.  Strengths and
weaknesses of model structures, numerics and parameterizations can be
assessed side-by-side.  The utility of model intercomparisons is greatly
enhanced if the models operate under the same external constraints, such as
dynamic and radiative input across model boundaries.  To this end,
participants in the Project to Intercompare Regional Climate Simulations
(PIRCS) will perform a common set of simulations with regional climate models
and produce a common output set, both designed to highlight strengths and
weaknesses of individual models and of this general approach to simulating
regional climate.<p>

This intercomparison activity continues under the
auspices of Iowa State University. PIRCS will seek
involvement of scientists from a wide range of countries.  PIRCS will
promote this involvement by establishing straightforward access for
interested researchers to model output and verification data sets generated
for the project by its participants.  In addition, PIRCS will facilitate
the development of collaborations between modeling groups and researchers
in developing countries who wish greater involvement in regional climate
modeling.<p>


PIRCS will also seek to coordinate its activities with related
international programs occurring under the auspices of the <a
href="http://www.wmo.ch">World
Meteorological Organization's</a> Working Group on Numerical Experimentation,
the Global Energy and Water Cycles Experiment <a
href="http://www.cais.com/gewex/gewex1.html">(GEWEX)</a>, and the U.N. Food
and Agriculture Organization.  Specific programs include the Comparison of
Mesoscale Prediction and Research Experiments <a
href="http://antietam.nssl.uoknor.edu/mosaic_files/sref/compare.html">
(COMPARE)</a>, the Atmospheric
Model Intercomparison Experiment <a
href="http://www-pcmdi.llnl.gov/amip/amiphome.html">(AMIP)</a>, the Project for Intercomparison of
Land-surface Parameterization Schemes <a
href="http://cic.mq.edu.au/pilps-rice/">(PILPS)</a>, and the GEWEX Numerical
Experimentation Panel (GNEP).  The baseline of experience in these and
other groups will facilitate productive evolution of PIRCS.  Through this
coordination, PIRCS will become a focal point for research and discussion
revolving around regional climate simulation.</font>
