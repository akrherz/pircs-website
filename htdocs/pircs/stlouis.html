    <h2><font color="#0000FF">1. Introduction and agenda</font></h2>
    <p>The meeting was preceded by a buffet dinner sponsored by
    EPRI. Gutowski introduced the meeting agenda, which focuses
    primarily on results from PIRCS Experiment 1a and plans for
    their publication. He also thanked EPRI (through Chuck
    Hakkarinen) for sponsoring the meeting, and NOAA's Rick
    Lawford for logistical support.</p>
    <h2><font color="#0000FF">2. Preliminary results from the
    models</font></h2>
    <h3><font color="#FF0000">2.1 Precipitation trends</font></h3>
    <p>Gutowski showed preliminary analyses by the Iowa State
    group that focus on a portion of the Upper Mississippi River
    basin between 37-47 N latitude and 89-99 W longitude.
    Considerations in selecting this region include: (1) the
    region will provide a contrast between 1988 and 1993, since
    it includes the peak precipitation area of the 1993 flood;
    (2) the area is relatively large from the standpoint of a
    regional model (of order 400 grid points) but relatively
    small in terms of a GCM or the NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis; and (3)
    the region does not extend into Canada, so that U.S. data
    sets (such as the gridded hourly precipitation data set of
    Higgins et al. 1996) can be used for comparison to the
    models.</p>
    <p>Gutowski compared results for total precipitation
    (convective and stable) from seven of the PIRCS models to
    observed precipitation from the Higgins data set. The models
    generally are able to replicate wet and dry spells in
    the observations, but the amounts may be underpredicted or
    overpredicted. A simple &quot;consensus&quot; (arithmetic
    mean of the participating models) tracks the observed
    precipitation rather well. Liston brought up the point that
    the Higgins data are on a relatively coarse resolution and
    that we should generate a higher-resolution analysis for
    comparison to the models. The Iowa State group noted that
    they had already begun to develop such analyses. The Higgins
    data were used because of the short lead time
    for this meeting (models results having been
    provided as little as two days before). </p>
    <p>Evaluation of model performance for different types of
    events can give a perspective on how the models handle
    different types of forcing (e.g., large-scale versus
    convective or mesoscale). Differences between convective and
    stratiform precipitation in the models can also give
    information on how the models respond to different types of
    forcing. To this end, Takle described the 
    <A HREF="episodes.html">synoptic
    characteristics of specific precipitation episodes during
    PIRCS 1a.</A> The early part of the period was dominated by
    large-scale synoptic events; all models captured the timing
    of these. A dry period around Julian day 159 also was
    represented by all models as was a convective event around
    day 160. Days 165-180 had small convective events popping up
    across the upper Mississippi Basin region, with all models
    capturing something, though timing may not always be precise.
    Pielke noted that the models differ on whether precipitation
    is represented as convective or stratiform. All models give
    convective precipitation dominating on days 165-180, though
    Pielke mentioned that all miss the dry period at day 187. A
    handout was distributed with some of these results.</p>
    <p>The two versions of RSM differ in the relative
    representation of convective and stratiform precipitation for
    several episodes. The Scripps version of the RSM includes the
    physics from the operational, global spectral 
    model, while the NCEP version
    has modifications to the physics introduced by Hong. 
    Liston commented that all
    the models apparently capture the lateral boundary forcing as
    indicated by the timing of specific precipitation episodes.
    Hakkarinen pointed out that the models perform somewhat more
    poorly toward the end of the period, and several in the
    audience mentioned that this may point to the implications of
    soil moisture feedbacks.</p>
    <p>Gutowski showed maps of cumulative precipitation from four
    models. All have a dry area in the lower Mississippi River
    basin that does not appear in the observations. The nocturnal
    fraction in most of the models exhibits strong spatial
    gradients that may not be physically realistic, and the
    models underrepresent the nocturnal maximum in the central
    U.S. Hong pointed out that convection schemes generally tend
    to initiate precipitation during the daytime. RAMS seems to
    give the most realistic nocturnal maximum in the central
    U.S., though its precipitation tends to be too low. Wilby
    asked whether the spatial patterns should be looked at
    separately for convective or stratiform episodes. Liston
    mentioned that to evaluate the daytime versus nocturnal
    precipitation there are several factors that must be
    accounted for; e.g., there must a significant amount of
    precipitation and not just a few isolated events. Hakkarinen
    mentioned that the RAMS precipitation appears to most
    strongly aligned with the underlying terrain and coastlines.</p>
    <h3><font color="#FF0000">2.2
    Low-level jets</font></h3>
    <p>Arritt presented analyses of
    the low-level jet in several of the models based on the
    criteria of Bonner (1968, Mon. Wea. Rev.). In 1988 the
    profilers had not yet been deployed so there is not a good
    source of observed data. Therefore the NCEP reanalysis is
    being used for preliminary evaluations. Comparison with
    profiler observations shows that the reanalysis itself has
    biases, including too many LLJs (Bonner's criterion 1) in the
    southern Great Plains and too few in the northern Great
    Plains. Incidence of strong LLJs (Bonner's criterion 3) is
    severely underrepresented in the reanalysis, perhaps because
    the reanalysis terrain is too coarse. It is noteworthy that mesoscale
    models tend to produce more LLJs than the reanalysis. For
    1988 the region of high LLJ frequency tends to be to north of
    the climatological distribution, as expected in a dry year.</p>
    <p>MM5 gives a pattern of LLJ
    frequency that is similar to the reanalysis, but with
    generally higher incidence of LLJs. DARLAM does not extend
    quite as far north in maximum LLJ frequency and tends to get
    more strong LLJs. RAMS has a relatively high incidence of
    LLJs and a tendency for spatial patterns of LLJ occurrence to
    follow the Bermuda high. Several models show a Y-shaped or
    &quot;branched&quot; distribution with swaths of high LLJ
    incidence to the west along the foothills of the Rocky
    Mountains and to the east along the periphery of the Bermuda
    high. RAMS output was provided on pressure levels and results
    may be different if data were used on the native levels of
    the model. The NCEP version of the RSM gives a somewhat lower
    frequency of LLJs than the other models, extending rather far
    north (again, as might be expected in a dry year).</p>
    <h3><font color="#FF0000">2.3
    Additional diagnostics</font></h3>
    <p>The Iowa State group has
    recently begun studying whether and how the regional models
    generate MCCs. This uses analysis of mesoscale anomalies
    based on the method of Jones et al. (1995, Quart. J. Roy.
    Met. Soc.). An example was given of (non-PIRCS) MM5 results
    from 1993 at 250 mb and 600 mb. There was vertically-aligned
    cyclonic convergence at 600 mb and anticyclonic divergence at
    250 mb that compared well with where the predicted
    precipitation occurred. Pielke noted that it would be of
    interest to compare different convective parameterizations in
    the same model.</p>
    <h2><font color="#0000FF">3.
    Discussion</font></h2>
    <p>Much of the discussion
    centered around the need to obtain additional data for
    comparison to the model results. Liston recommended that more
    work be done on bringing together data sets such as max/min
    temperature and solar radiation. He asked whether surface
    radiation could be used from the NCEP reanalysis. Roads
    mentioned that the reanalysis radiation has errors, but that
    it still could be useful to compare how the regional models
    differ from the reanalysis. Liston has processed
    &quot;Summary of the Day&quot; max/min temperatures in GRADS
    station format, and he showed maps of the max/min
    temperatures. Radar observations may be useful at least in a
    qualitative sense although quantitative rainfall estimates
    are not available for the PIRCS 1a case. Hakkarinen asked
    whether there are more details available on the precipitation
    especially for 1993. Alternative data sources may be
    available such as Bureau of Reclamation, USGS, Oklahoma
    Mesonet, and VEMAP. FIFE may have radiation and surface flux
    data for 1988. Lapenta mentioned that Baldocchi's group at
    Oak Ridge has long-term radiation data. Global Summary of the
    Day stations have surface pressure and humidity data.</p>
    <p>Pielke suggested calculation
    of thickness values and comparison with NCEP reanalysis.
    Roads mentioned that NCEP equitable threat and bias scores
    for precipitation thresholds could be used to evaluate
    models. In this vein, Gutowski reported that the Iowa State
    group is trying to compute histograms of precipitation
    intensity from cooperative station data. Liston says that
    surface RH is available on global summary of day; Wilby says
    these include max/min RH. Liston says first-order Summary of
    the Day includes additional data (about 300 stations). With
    regard to the NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis, Hong noted that upper
    atmosphere variables are fairly accurate but errors in 500 mb
    geopotential height can be as high as 20 m in southeastern
    US for 1988. It was pointed out that reanalysis variables in
    the lower atmosphere are strongly influenced by model
    physics.</p>
    <h2><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">4.
    Publication of PIRCS results</font></h2>
    <p>Gutowski stated that the Iowa
    State group will do continued analysis and will set up a web
    page to display the results. After some discussion a
    consensus was reached that the web page will not be
    passworded, but will not be publicly announced or linked from
    the main PIRCS page.</p>
    <p>The group as a whole will
    begin working on papers that report PIRCS. The first will be
    a general description of the results and procedures,
    including some examples of analysis products but not in-depth
    analysis. Shortly following would be a &quot;science
    paper&quot; with more detailed analysis focusing perhaps on
    how precipitation is coupled (or not) with mesoscale
    dynamics. There is a need to show what is the added value of
    regional models. For example, GCMs can produce low-level jets
    but still do not properly represent the diurnal cycle of
    precipitation. Roads mentioned that little attention has
    previously been given to diurnal variations in the
    reanalysis.</p>
    <p>Liston questioned whether we
    are ready to release the data sets to others and that we
    should take time to make sure that the models are at a
    credible stage. Takle mentioned WGNE and CLIVAR are looking
    to PIRCS to show added value from regional models. Gutowski
    noted that PIRCS has ongoing cooperation with MERCURE and
    that we should proceed in a timely manner in order to share
    information with them. Hakkarinen mentioned the push for
    regional impacts for the IPCC TAR and the U.S. national
    assessment of the state of science of impacts of climate
    change. New GCM runs also will be done with intent of serving
    as drivers for regional models. Roads says we need to push
    for the first paper but for the second we need more of a
    critical mass of participants, encouraging others to
    collaborate with us. Roads mentioned Fall AGU as a target
    date for another meeting.</p>
    <p>Pielke suggested the first
    (overview) paper be submitted for the GCIP special issue of
    JGR, for which manuscripts are due September 1. Roads
    mentioned that this would be highly visible. Such a date
    would be reasonable for the overview paper but the
    &quot;science&quot; paper would have to be later. Roads
    suggested a focus on aspects of the hydrological cycle, e.g.,
    evaporation and runoff, and distribution between convective
    and nonconvective precipitation. Liston recommended that the
    overview paper include results for upper level heights. Roads
    says we need to show differences from reanalysis. We could
    also show differences between 1993 and 1988 in the LLJ,
    perhaps a sample from one or a few models.</p>
