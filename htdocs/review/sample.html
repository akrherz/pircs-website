<font size=4>Sample html file</font>
<hr>
This is just a sample html file that I have placed in this directory 
so that it wasn't empty.  I have then made a sym link to it called index.html
so that is automatically loaded if the directory is referenced without a file 
name, as in<p>

If you create a different index file (most likely you will depending
on how you use this directory) you will want to remove this sym link in 
favour of the new file.
