<a name="motiv"></a>

<font class="subhead">Motivation</font><p>
<font class="text">The intent of the first experiment is to provide a 
first comparison of how well regional models represent aggregate 
characteristics of weather
events in a simulation long enough to include many such events, i.e. 
resolve climate. To this end, the experiment is designed to be relatively 
simple to perform and diagnose thereby facilitating wide-spread 
participation and the establishment of a framework for ongoing 
intercomparison. The experiment will contain the strong climate signals of persistent extreme 
events, which are expected to simplify the intercomparison by focusing diagnosis 
on dominant processes during these events.<p>

<P>The initial experiment focuses on a
primarily agricultural region with significant vulnerability to growing
season precipitation, a problem common to most developing countries. 
Accordingly, one emphasis of the intercomparison will be diagnosing the 
simulation of hydrologic processes. In order to complement related 
research programs, the initial experiment is also designed to overlap with 
activities of COMPARE, GEWEX (specifically G-NEG and GCIP) and AMIP.
</font><p>

<a name="locat"></a>
<font class="subhead">Location</font><p>

<font class="text">
The first experiment will focus on the central United States, a region
of intense cultivation containing a major watershed, the Mississippi River
basin. It is a region that has experienced episodes of both extreme 
drought
and extreme flooding within the past 10 years. This region is also the
focus of GCIP and planned activities by G-NEG.</font><p>

<a name="perio"></a>
<font class="subhead">Period</font>

<font class="text">
<p>The first experiment will contain two periods: the summer of 1988 
drought (Expt. 1a) and the summer of 1993 flooding (Expt. 1b). Experiment 
1a emphasizes thermal processes, whereas Experiment 1b emphasizes 
processes of the water cycle. Initial simulation and diagnosis will focus 
on the summer of 1988, but the coupled diagnosis of opposite extremes will 
constitute a more complete analysis of the systematic behavior of participating models. 
Simulations will be initialized using gridded analyses for 15 May 1988 and 
1 June 1993 and will last 60 days. The starting dates represent times by 
which persistent circulation features for each summer had become established.
</font><p>

<a name="simdo"></a>
<font class="subhead">Simulation Domain</font><p>

<font class="text">
The simulation domain will consist of two parts: a forced outer frame
and a &quot;free&quot; inner domain. Diagnostics will be computed for the
inner domain. The standard inner domain will be given by a 51 (N-S) x 101
(E-W) lat-lon grid with 1/2 degree resolution, with the central point 
located in the middle of the U.S. (lat. grid #26, lon. grid #51) = (37.5 
N, 100 W) <A HREF="http://www.pircs.iastate.edu/atmos/pircsreg.gif">(Fig. 
1)</A>.

<P>The PIRCS support staff has designed a nearly equivalent inner domain
for models using:
<ul>
 <li>a polar stereographic projection, with the central point
        (X grid #28, Y grid #41)=(37.5 N, 100 W)<A 
HREF="http://www.pircs.iastate.edu/atmos/pircspsg.gif">
        (Fig.2)</A> and 60 km resolution, or<p>
 <li>a Lambert conformal projection, which is true at 30 N and 60 N with a
        central point (X grid #51, Y grid #36)=(37.50 N, 100.00 W) and 52 
km resolution.
</ul>
<font class="text">
<P>Precise structure of the inner and outer domains may vary between 
models depending on their numerical procedures. It is expected that 
participants in the intercomparison will use the lateral boundary 
conditions given in the outer frame as appropriate for their model and 
that no model will include explicit external forcing within the domain 
covered by the standard &quot;free&quot; grid.

<P>In the vertical direction, each model will use its own coordinate, grid
and resolution: there is no standard vertical grid.</font><p>

<a name="ilbcs"></a>

<font class="subhead">Atmospheric Initial and Lateral Boundary 
Conditions</font><p>

<font class="text">
The PIRCS support staff will provide initial conditions for the simulation
domain described above from re-analysis output produced by the U.S. 
National Meteorological Center. In order to facilitate the participation 
of a wide variety of models, and guided by the COMPARE program, PIRCS will 
distribute data on three grids: a background, global grid at 2 1/2 degree 
resolution, forcing-frame (outer domain) data at 1/2 degree resolution on 
the lat-lon grid, and forcing-frame data at 60 km resolution on the polar 
stereographic grid. Data for lateral boundary conditions will be provided 
every 6 hours.

<P>The variables provided will be the horizontal wind components (u, v),
temperature T, specific humidity q, the surface pressure p_sfc of the 
reanalysis model and the topography used by the re-analysis model. Data 
will be provided at 25 mb resolution. PIRCS will provide the algorithm for 
vertical interpolation of surface pressure to the individual model's 
topographic height.</font><p>

<a name="sfccd"></a>
<font class="subhead">Surface Conditions</font><p>

<font class="text">
The PIRCS support staff will provide soil-moisture for initial conditions
and periodic ocean and lake surface temperatures for lower boundary 
conditions. For a number of reasons, precise determination of the field of 
soil moisture on each starting date will be difficult. The soil-moisture 
conditions that will be distributed are intended to provide a consistent, 
reasonably accurate initial condition for all models. Therefore, while 
these values can be converted to units appropriate for each model, they 
should not be adjusted toward drier or more moist conditions.

<P>For simplicity, each modeling group is encouraged to use their model's
topography and land characterization procedures already established for
this region, if they exist. The PIRCS support staff, however, will provide
a reference topography and land-characterization dataset for participants
needing this information.</font><p>

<font class="subhead">Convection and Radiation</font><p>

<font class="text">
The choice of cumulus convection and radiation schemes is left to each
modeling group.</font><p>

<a name="diagn"></a>
<font class="subhead">Diagnostics</font><p>

<font class="text">
Modelers submitting output to PIRCS should read and adhere
carefully to the <A HREF="./dataformat.html">format for transmitting
model output </A> to the PIRCS archive.
<P>Primary diagnostics will consist of heat, moisture and energy budgets
on scales finer than typically resolved by global models. All spatially
varying output should be reported on the model's grid for the inner 
domain. The PIRCS archive will collect from each participating group a 
standard archive <A HREF="./table1.html">(Table 1)</A>. The archive 
emphasizes mesoscale circulation and diurnal cycles of energy and moisture 
fluxes at the surface. A supplemental data set (<a href="./table2.html">
Table 2</a>) is also requested from those with the means to assemble it.

<P>Participants will be strongly encouraged to save at their institutions
hourly histories of the prognostic variables. PIRCS requests that archives
contain sufficient history information so that comparisons that are either
unanticipated by PIRCS or that go beyond the scope of the initial 
comparison may still be performed. Examples of the latter would include 
analysis of vertical fluxes of heat and moisture generated by convection 
and their impact on resolved dynamics and study of the interaction between 
clouds in the planetary boundary layer (PBL), radiation and other PBL 
processes.

<P>For Expt. 1a (drought year), diagnostic emphasis for the 
intercomparison will be on the evolution of the thermal processes across 
the domain, as characterized by the surface and atmospheric thermal energy 
budgets. A comparison of hydrologic processes for this case of weak 
hydrologic cycle will also be performed, but it is expected that this 
comparison in particular will not be complete until the strong hydrologic 
cycle of the 1993 flood period is also simulated and diagnosed.</font><p>
