<p>
Climate changes from two simulations by regional climate models
(HIRHAM and RegCM2) driven by HadCM2 for 10-year
periods. The model domain is the same as used by the Project
to Intercompare Regional Climate Simulations (PIRCS). 
<p>
Climate changes are differences between simulations using the HadCM2
scenario and control climates.  The scenario period corresponds
roughly to 2040-2050.  The changes by HIRHAM and RegCM2 correspond
roughly to differences between the 2040's and the 1990's.  For HadCM2
figures, the differences are (2040-2069) minus (1961-1990).

<h3>(1) Daily maximum temperature</h3>
<p>
These maps show the change in 10-year average daily maximum temperature
[deg C] by season (winter=Dec-Jan-Feb, etc.)  Contour interval:  0.6
deg C, from -3.9 deg C

<h3>(2) Daily minimum temperature</h3>

The same as (1), but for daily minimum temperature climatology.
