<p>
The "Robert Johnson" box covers approximately the Mississippi River
Delta region.  Its boundaries are (31-35 N, 85-90 W).

<h3>(1) S-O-N Precipitation</h3>
<p>
Daily precipitation averaged over the Robert Johnson box from the
Higgins observational data and from the 10-year
RegCM2 simulation driven by NCEP reanalyses.
<p>
The figures below are September-October-November time series for each
of the years.  Vertical lines separate the three months.  RegCM2
precipitation has been multiplied by (-1) to help distinguish the two
time series.
<p>
Perfect reproduction of the Higgins observations would result in two
curves that are mirror images of each other.  The overall impression
is that RegCM is doing a fairly good job at 
reproducing the frequency of precipitation events, but that it
generally produces too little precipitation for most events.  Fall 1983 might be an especially good period to examine causes for the rainfall deficiency in the RegCM simulation.
