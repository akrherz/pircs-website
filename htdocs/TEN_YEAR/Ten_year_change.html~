<p>
Climatologies from two simulations by regional climate models
(HIRHAM and RegCM2) driven by the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis for the 10-year
period 1979-1988.  The observed climatology used for comparison covers
the same period.  The model domain is the same as used by the Project
to Intercompare Regional Climate Simulations (PIRCS).

Results linked to this page are preliminary.  They
should not be discussed, cited or otherwise referenced
without consulting DMI and ISU modelers who produced these results.
<p>

<h3>(1) Elevation</h3>
<p>
A common elevation grid at 1/2 degree has been produced from
<b>((PLEASE FILL
IN))</b> using a Cressman scheme for horizontal interpolation.  Model
and observing station elevations have also been interpolated to the
1/2 degree grid using the same Cressman scheme.   These figures show
differences between
<br> 
- each model and the common grid elevations
<br>
- observing station elevations and the common grid elevations.
<br>
Contour interval:  250 m, from -1375 m.

<h3>(2) Daily maximum temperature</h3>
<p>
These maps show the 10-year climatology of daily maximum temperature
[deg C] by month of the year.  Each month has three panels:
<pre>
model climatology     model-obs bias     observed climatology
</pre>
Months are grouped according to meteorological seasons (Dec-Jan-Feb,
etc.)  Contour interval:  5 deg C, from -17.5 deg C
