<P>
<H2><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">File naming convention</FONT></H2>
I have assembled the Hadley Centre data into separate
files for each calendar month.  Each monthly file 
contains data records every six hours for
the entire month.  In the
Hadley Centre calendar each "month" consists of 30 days
(so that a year has 360 days).
Each monthly file begins with data for 00 UTC on the
1st of the month and ends with data for 18 UTC on the
30th of the month.  
<P>
The file naming convention for the monthly data files
is a modification of the
Hadley Centre file name protocol.  The file names are of
the form:
<PRE>
EEEEES.YYYY.MM
</PRE>
<ul><li>The six-character prefix <b>EEEEES</b> follows the Hadley Centre format,
where <b>EEEEE</b> is the experiment name (<b>aaxne</b> for the control
climate, <b>aaxnf</b> for increasing CO2) and
<b>S</b> is the data stream
(<b>a</b> for atmosphere, <b>o</b> for ocean)  
<li><b>YYYY</b> gives
the year</li>
<li><b>MM</b> gives the month</llib>
</ul>
For example,
<PRE>
aaxnea.2044.04
</PRE>
is the file containing control-climate data for
April 2044.  
<P>
<H2><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">Data structure and format</FONT></H2>
Data are stored on our SGI Origin Vault.  The files are
stored as unformatted binary data in "big endian" byte
order.  Both real and integer values are stored as 32-bit
variables.
<P>
Each six-hourly sequence begins with a three-record header
that gives some basic information about the data:  
<UL>
<LI>The first
record consists of three integers that give the number of 
grid points in the X, Y and Z directions.   
<LI>The second record contains four integers that give
the year, month, day and hour for the data.  The data are
instantaneous values at the end of the Hadley Centre model
time step that ends at the indicated date and time.
<LI>The third record is four real values that give the 
longitude and latitude of the southwest corner of the
domain, and the grid increments for longitude and latitude.
</UL>
<H2><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">Reading the data files</FONT></H2>
At the end of this page is a Fortran subroutine that will read the data for a
single six-hour entry in the monthly data file.  The code
contains extensive comments that explain the
variables in the data set.
<p>Please let me know if you have any questions.

C-------- Subroutine to read the Hadley Centre monthly data.

C-------- On entry:
C            NX, NY, NZ = dimensions of the data arrays.  These
C               must be greater than or equal to the actual number
C               of values along each coordinate.
C            NIN = Fortran logical unit number for the data file.
C            
C-------- On return:
C            PST = array of p-star (scaling pressure), in Pascals
C            U, V = arrays of U and V wind components, in m/s
C            THETA = array of potential temperature, in Kelvins
C            Q = array of specific humidity.  Dimensionless; may be
C               interpreted as kg/kg
C            KNX, KNY, KNZ = actual number of data values along each
C               coordinate (KNZ applies only to 3D arrays)
C            IYEAR, IMO, IDAY = year, month and day of this data record
C            IHOUR = hour (0-23) of this data record.         
C            SWLON, SWLAT = longitude and latitude of the grid point
C               at the southwest corner of the thermodynamic grid.
C               The velocity points are staggered 1/2 grid point
C               south and east of the thermodynamic points.
C            DELON, DELAT = grid spacing (degrees) for longitude
C               and latitude. 

           
C-------- Read and echo the number of grid points in this
C-------- data set for each coordinate.

       READ (NIN)  KNX, KNY, KNZ

C-------- Check if the data arrays are large enough.

       IF (KNX .GT. NX .OR. KNY .GT. NY .OR. KNZ .GT. NZ)  THEN
