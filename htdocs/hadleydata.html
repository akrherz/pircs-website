<H1>Instructions for Processing Hadley Centre Data</H1>
<P>
<B>Create a working directory:</B>  Create a directory for the
data processing.  (This could be your home directory if you 
want.) Under this directory create a parent directory for the
Hadley Centre model data.  It is recommended that this
directory be called <B>HadCM</B> because otherwise you would need to
change references to this directory name in various scripts.
<P>
<B>Extract the data:</B> Change to the HadCM directory and
extract the data from the tapes using the usual 
Unix "tar" command.  This would be something like
<PRE>
tar xvf /dev/tape >& ../tar_list
</PRE>
In the example above, the list of contents of the tar volume
and any other diagnostic output is written to a file
called "tar.list" which resides in the level above the HadCM
directory. Notice that we didn't write this to the HadCM
directory, but instead to the directory one level up. 
It is best to keep everything except the data out
of the HadCM directory.
<P>
<B>Check the data:</B> Programs and a script have been written
that perform crude checks for physical realism and completeness
of the data.  
<P>
<B>Explode the archive files into individual times:</B> The source
code for this is a program called explode.f and a C-shell script
for exploding multiple files is explode.csh.  The only argument
to explode.csh is the name of the directory below HadCM
that contains the 
files to be exploded:
<PRE>
/bin/csh explode.csh aaxnea.pjo1 >& explode.csh.aaxnea.pjo1.out
</PRE>
<P>
