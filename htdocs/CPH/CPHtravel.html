<b>Airport to hotel</b>
<p>
<p>
Getting from the airport to the hotel 
(<a href="http://hotelbook.com/static/welcome_02661.html#top">Scandic Hotel</a>, Kettevej 4,
Hvidovre). You buy a ticket for 4 zones before descending to the
platform, take the train from the airport, direction Helsingør. Get off
at the main railway station (København H). Walk AWAY from the station
building on the platform, to the bridge across the rails. From there,
take bus 650S for around 17 min., direction Avedøre. You should get off
at a stop called Hvidovre Hospitals Kollegium (Hvidovre hospital
student's home) and from there walk 2 minutes, everything according to
http://www.rejseplanen.dk which can be used for concrete travel plans if
you can guess the meaning of the forms (they are in Danish). 
Bus schedules and zone
information can be obtained at http://www.ht.dk (click the link
"Turist"  for information in English). 
</p>

<p><b>Hotel to DMI</b></p>
<p>
Getting from the hotel to DMI with public transportation can be done in
a multitude of ways. The simplest, involving only one change, requires
the bus 650S in the opposite direction, Hellerup, getting off at the
main station. Then take S-train H or H+, direction Farum, and get off at
Ryparken. DMI is the red brick thing right next to the tracks. This
requires a 3 zone ticket. With more complex routes you can do it with 2
zones.
</p>

<p>
Tickets can be bought in buses, in vending machines at stations, and at
ticket booths. You can buy 10-trip cards (klippekort) for 2, 3, 4 etc.
zones per stamp at around 2/3 of the price if you go together or will
travel a lot. There are also one- or 3-day partout passes, but 
they are expensive.

<p><b>Hotel Reservations</b></p>
<p>A block of hotel rooms has been reserved for the week of the meeting.
Owing to a convention taking place the same week, hotel rooms in Copenhagen
are expected to be scarce and attendees should reserve rooms promptly.  To
book a room contact Gitte Sejersen at DMI, email <a href="mailto:gs@dmi.dk">gs@dmi.dk</a> for further
information.  Please also notify us by return email if you plan to attend.</p>
