<blockquote>
<p>The Project to Intercompare Regional Climate Simulations (PIRCS) will hold
a workshop in coordination with the EU program MERCURE during the period
22-25 May 2000.  The Danish Meteorological Institute (DMI), Copenhagen,
Denmark has graciously offered to host the meeting.  

<p>The intent in coordinating MERCURE and PIRCS is to promote interaction
among most of the world's leading regional climate modeling groups.  The
first two days (22-23 May) will be devoted primarily to discussion of PIRCS
and the second two days will be devoted primarily to MERCURE, with
participants in each project being encouraged to attend the other's
session.  
PIRCS participants should forward suggested agenda items 
to <a href="mailto:pircs@iastate.edu">pircs@iastate.edu</a> . 

<P>For details, please click on the links in the bar at the left.
The agenda will be kept in dynamic form on this web page.

<P>We look forward to a lively and informative workshop in Copenhagen.
</center></p>
