We presentsimulations of extreme precipitation periods for the central USand conclude that regional climate models are capable ofreproducing the mass, wind fields, and moisture movement criticalfor generating precipitation. The region being studied has acomplex combination of dynamical and thermodynamical processesthat lead to extreme precipitation events. The model successfullycaptures these processes, although some discrepancies in thetiming and magnitude lead to precipitation fields that are closebut not exact matches of observed patterns.1.   Introduction     Understanding present and future characteristics andvariability of the hydrological cycle requires that we developphysically consistent simulations of present and future climateon scales critical for management and long-term planning forwater resources, agriculture, and natural ecosystems. Ofparticular interest is the ability to simulate extremehydrological events such as floods and droughts. We arecoordinating simulations of regional hydrological climates by useof limited-area climate models that are designed to (1) evaluatestrengths and weaknesses of regional climate models, includingimprovement over results of global climate models, when comparedwith observations, and (2) develop high-resolution regionalclimates consistent with global model simulations of the presentclimate and future climates perturbed by increased greenhousegases and sulfate aerosols.     The focus of our studies is on the central US wheresummertime precipitation is governed by a complex combination ofmesoscale processes. Figure 1 (Takle, 1995 as adapted fromWallace and Hobbs, 1997) shows the diurnal pattern ofprecipitation in this region. Directions of arrows on this mapindicate time of day (24-h clock) that summertime precipitationreaches its diurnal maximum. Most regions of the US have maximumbetween noon (northward pointing vector) and 6 PM LST (eastwardpointing vector). The US Midwest, by contrast, has a distinctnocturnal (midnight, as indicated by southward pointing vector)maximum. Length of the arrow gives the amplitude of the maximumfrequency divided by the mean hourly frequency. Details ofprecipitation regimes in this region are given by Takle (1995),but it well known that the nocturnal low-level jet (LLJ) plays asignificant role in moisture transport leading to thisprecipitation anomaly. This complex combination of moistureavailability and mesoscale dynamical processes make this achallenging region for simulation of the climatology ofprecipitation.2.   Simulations of Periods of Drought and Flood     Two 60-day simulations were performed for the US Midwest,one for the 1988 drought (15 May - 15 July 1988) and the otherfor the 1993 flood (1 June - 31 July 1993) with boundaryconditions supplied from the reanalyzed data of the US NationalCenter for Atmospheric Research and National Centers forEnvironmental Prediction and implemented over a boundary-condition fram beyond the continental US. Results shown hereinwere produced by the RegCM model (Giorgi et al 1993a, b).Drought Period     Analysis of the precipitable water fields (not shown)produced by the model for the summer of 1988 revealed that themodel simulated very well the large region of water vapor deficitover the western third of the US. The observed west-to-eastgradient of precipitable water over the Great Plains, extendingfrom the Canadian border well into Mexico, also is present in thesimulated fields, although the model gradient is not as large.For the eastern half of the US, the observed fields contained arelatively smooth reduction in precipitable water from a highover the Gulf of Mexico to a minimum north of the Canadianborder. The model tended to produce precipitable water valuesthat were lower, more spatially irregular, and having lower north-to-south gradient over this region.     Figure 2a gives a cross-section of the simulated northward(meridional) component of the wind at 06 UTC at 35oN for the 60-day period in summer of 1988. The model simulates the coastaljets and a northward 8 m/s LLJ in the central US as compared withthe observed 7 m/s wind for this period as shown in Figure 2b.For contrast, the observed (and simulated) 1993 LLJ shown laterreaches a magnitude of 13 m/s. It is clear from these figuresthat the model is capturing the LLJ and its suppressed magnitudedue to large-scale circulation during the 1988 drought period.     Total precipitation produced by the model for the 60-dayperiod in 1988 is shown in Figure 3a and observed values for thesame period are shown in Figure 3b. Although the simulated valuesare slightly too large over the Great Basin, the model producedgenerally quite good representation of precipitation over thewestern half of the US as well as the maximum over Florida.Largest discrepancies between model and observations were insouthern Louisiana (simulated values too low), along the easternseaboard (simulated value high), and in the Iowa-Wisconsin region(simulated value high).Flood Period     The precipitable water fields (not shown) for 1993, bothmodeled and observed, showed the same (as 1988) large region ofwater vapor deficit over the Great Basin in the western third ofthe US, the west-to-east gradient over the Great Plains, and thenorth-to-south gradient over the eastern half of the US. The onlydeficiency of the modeled precipitable water for 1993 was a highvalue over Mississippi and low value in the western Gulf ofMexico. It is noteworthy that the only major difference betweenthe precipitable water fields between the drought year and theflood year was a northward penetration of the Gulf dome ofprecipitable water into the central US as far north as centralMissouri. The flood region was to the north and west of this domein the observed data and more directly north of the dome in themodeled precipitation. The northward displacement of the regionof highest precipitation from the region of highest precipitablewater confirms the importance of mesoscale dynamical processes ingoverning the spatial details of precipitation in this regionduring flood conditions.     The peak value of the modeled precipitation (see Figure 4a)was about 550 mm whereas the observed maximum (see Figure 4b) wassomewhat in excess of 450 mm. The modeled maximum was displacedto the northeast of the observed location by about 300 km, whichis still within about 1 GCM grid box. The model produced verygood precipitation patterns in the western US but failed tocapture the precipitation maximum along the Gulf coast and theminimum in the southeast US.     The enhanced LLJ simulated by the model (Figure 5a) andobserved (Figure 5b) is consistent with dynamical processes knownto accompany intense precipitation events in the region. Thedisplacement by the model of the precipitation region to thenortheast of the observed location suggests that the model yetlacks some details of the coupling of the dynamics andthermodynamics with the moisture fields. This is furtherconfirmed by the lack of a strong diurnal cycle as required byFigure 1. As an aside, we also have simulated this period with adifferent model that, for this case, has much better placement ofthe precipitation maximum. This provides encouragement thatmodels eventually will be able to simulate correctly theposition, timing and interrelationships of complex processesleading to precipitation in this region.Impact of Surface Wetness on Precipitation for Extreme Events     Pan et al (1995) artificially changed the surface wetnessfor these 1988 and 1993 extreme rainfall periods to examine therole of moisture recycling on precipitation. They found that anartificially moistened surface during a drought period would havelittle impact on subsequent rainfall, but that artificially driedsurfaces during flood periods will reduce rainfall. Hence therelative contribution to water recycling by localevapotranspiration is much less important during drought ascompared to flood conditions.Specific Events during the Flood Period     Detailed analysis of individual events during the flood of1993 by Pan et al (1996) showed that spatial details (e.g.,orientation of the precipitation footprint, shape of theprecipitation region, occurrence of multiple precipitationmaxima) were well simulated in some but not all cases and dependon details of the model parameterization of precipitation. Theyfurther found that specific rainfall maxima within a contiguousprecipitation footprint may have opposite sensitivities tounderlying evapotranspiration. For the case studied, the totalrainfall at one rainfall center diminished when the surface wasartificially moistened whereas a nearby local maximum wasenhanced. Detailed analysis revealed that rainfall will beenhanced (reduced) by surface wetness if the convective boundarylayer lacks sufficient moisture (heating) to increase rainfall.     Effects of surface processes on rainfall in the US involve acomplex interplay between thermodynamics and dynamics bothlocally and remotely. The LLJ was observed to strengthen (weaken)when surface soil becomes dry (wet). The intensified LLJ over adry surface provides abundant moisture and instability forprecipitation systems, thereby negating the impact of decreasedevapotranspiration. On the other hand, in the western US, wherethe atmosphere is relatively dry and there are no prominentdynamic factors such as the LLJ, rainfall tends to be moredependent on local thermodynamic conditions.Dependence on Land use     Pan et al (1998) investigated the impact of land use onprecipitation by artificially changing surface vegetationconditions with all other conditions being unchanged for periodsof flood, drought, and normal rainfall. They found that undernormal-year conditions, current land use has increased rainfallby about 8% over the central US (due to agricultural crops whichtranspire more than native plants) and decreased rainfallslightly over the western US. In extreme years, current land usedecreases rainfall over the central US and increasesprecipitation over the western US. The decreased rainfall in thecentral US is associated with a weakening of the LLJ due toreduced daytime sensible heat flux over the southern GreatPlains. This also demonstrates the critical role of mesoscaledynamics in controlling precipitation in this region.3.   Summary     We have demonstrated that a regional climate model simulateswell the mass and wind fields, including the LLJ that isresponsible for movement of moisture within the domain, whensupplied with boundary conditions far from the region ofinterest. Results also indicate that the model produces aggregateprecipitation values well below normal, as observed, during thedrought year although spatial distributions did not match exactlyto observations. For the flood year, the model produced wellabove normal precipitation in the upper Midwest corresponding toperiods of observed flooding, although precise timing, locationand amounts did not match observations. Ability of the model tosimulate dynamical processes known to be critical toprecipitation in this region offer encouragement for future modelsimulations of precipitation details critical to water resourcesresearch.Acknowledgments.
