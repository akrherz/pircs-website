<font class="subhead">Additional notes on Day 160 (June 8)</font>

    <p><font class="text">Day 160 (June 8) may offer a unique opportunity 
to test
    the capabilities of a regional climate model to simulate
    significant isolated precipitation events at scales well
    below those resolvable by GCMs.</p>

    <p>The Higgins precipitation for this day over the analysis
    subdomain had a spike, with no rain on adjacent days. The
    FIFE data (the FIFE region is near the western boundary of
    the analysis subdomain) also had a spike, but on June 7. Des
    Moines had a thunderstorm at midnight (6/7-8) followed by
    more rain until about sunrise on the 8th. The daily weather
    map showed a system with precip footprint about the size of
    the state of Iowa with center tracking west to east along the
    IA/MO border. This event was quite isolated in both space
    (everywhere else in the Midwest was dry) and time (2 or more
    days ahead and a day or two after were dry).</p>

    <p>There is a brief switch to southerly winds on the morning
    of the 8th at the surface with the emergence of a weak Hi in
    the Gulf. This could have supported a jet with sufficient
    moisture to fuel the system into an MCC.</p>

    <p>If, in fact, this it is generally possible to capture such
    an event and get it in the right place at the right time and
    produce substantial precip because of a timely but brief
    switch of the low-level winds, this could be a very
    supportive demonstration of the utility of a regional climate
    model.</p>

    <p>Several models reporting at the St. Louis meeting may have
    captured the timing as well as the spatial and temporal
    extent of this event. Participants are encouraged to further
    investigate representation of this event in their model
    results.</p></font>
