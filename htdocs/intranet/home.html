            After all we went through with the 9 gig drive (it's on its way to be 
            replaced by the way) we are now having trouble with the 4mm. I will let 
            people know via email.</P>

            I have also placed an archive of my email (good, bad, typo's and all) 
            on-line and will link it into this page soon for people to have for 
            their records. <A HREF="email/default.html">You can take an

<B><I>MPI networking news:</I></B><BR>
 I am working up some pages on the MPI network on the PIRCS systems. 
Including locations of the programs and libraries and header files and 
some example code from various locations.</P>
<P>
<B><I>Vincent NFS:</I></B><BR>
 Pan and I discovered a problem with the NFS mounting being done by the <A
 HREF="vincent.html">PIRCS Vincent Alpha's</A>. This did not affect the 
other UNIX machines. However, it did make the Vincent systems 
unuasable. This was resolved, finally, with a option to the mount 
string making it look like:<BR>
 <B>mount -t nfs -o vers=2 pircss0.agron.iastate.edu:/usr/people/pircs 
./pircs</B><BR>
 Note the vers=2 option, which was required. Vincent claims NFS3 
support, but does not seem to fully have it in fact. The other 
non-vincent DEC's were fine at version 3. You will need to go root o 
the system to do this, just type su and when prompted for a passwd, 
give your normal vincent passwd.</P>
