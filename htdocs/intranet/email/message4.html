Pircs, </P>

It's 4:45 am and just to let you know the traffic around the ESSL lab 
is lite. </P>

I have recovered what I can from people directories which comes to 
about 18 megs I think. Again I don't know what state this 18 megs is in 
but we will know shortly. The server is now fully up and running great. 
As I get the tapes off (Dennis yours is done) I will let people know. 
Look for a directory RESCUE that has your files in it. I would write 
more and I have alot to say... but I extreamly tired and must go, I 
will try and be in as soon as I can in the morning, but I need some 
sleep really bad.</P>
