We have some _small_ good news. I have been able to recover about 7 
gigs of Dennis Todey's files. I am moving these to tape and will begin 
to try and recover files for other people. I can say if these 7 gigs of 
files or any other files I may get are valid or corrupt. We will have 
to recover what data we can and then rebuild the drive plex and archive 
off tape and then see what we have. Rebuilding the plex will only take 
about 20 minutes. Moving the data to and from tape is much slower as 
you all know. I have spoken with both Dave, and Pan, about the priority 
of the files in their directories that they would like to have 
recovered. Others should let me know about their status. I have also 
put together some structure of the back-up system we will use to plug 
this single failure point hole we have/had. I will post this 
information to the WWW server and inform you of it via email when it is 
ready. </P>
