Subject: NFS <BR>
Date: Thu, 11 Sep 1997 09:33:10 CDT <BR>
From: &quot;Douglas R. Fils&quot; </P>
<P>
Situation: NFS not working or working oddly </P>
<P>
Reason: I had turned NFS during the file recovery to prevent people 
from trying to change files via NFS (plus has the item mounted read 
only without informing the NFS mount points that its status had 
changed) and not turned it back on, sorry. </P>
<P>
Solution: Restarted NFS on the server and fixed the problem on all the 
UNIX machines in the ESSL lab including vincent stations. </P>
