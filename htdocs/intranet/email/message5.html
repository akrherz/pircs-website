Good morning, </P>
<P>
Well, a couple hours of sleep can do wonders. First off sorry for the 
mail I sent at 4:30, this morning, I should know better. Second, it's 
18 gigs (not megs) that i finally recovered. I hope everyone assumed 
that. One hour per gig I don't mind, per meg would have been a bit 
much. The drives are all fully reasembled and I am restoring from tape. 
I estimate that I will be done with the last of the tapes sometime 
around noon or early afternoon. At that time I will set all the file 
permissions and give everyone now another status report. I completed 
the back-up scripts and have assembled the required tapes. Under this 
mechanism, date will be backed up on the server approximately every 3 
1/2 days.</P>
