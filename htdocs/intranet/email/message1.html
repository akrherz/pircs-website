Subject: major failure of one of the server 9 gig drives <BR>

A major hardware failure of one of the 9 gig drives on the PIRCS 
machine has destroyed data on the /usr/people/pircs directory. 
Affecting the other 2 drives that made this partition up. Home 
directories, the WWW and ftp services are _not_ affected and their 
files are ok. Actually they were affected too, but I was able to 
recover them quickly. I am currently working on this problem and will 
keep you up to date on the outcome. I am attempting to fix the problem 
at the block level manually with the drive(s). </P>
<P>
wish me luck <BR>
