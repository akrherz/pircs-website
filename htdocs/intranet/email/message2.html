Things are looking very bad. We may have lost data on /usr/people/pircs 
which is not backed up. File systems /usr/people/$USERNAME (your home 
directories) and the ftp and WWW files have been totally recovered 
either from xfs_rescue or from tape (they were backed up to tape). 
However, since /usr/people/pircs was so large and people were using the 
8mm to make tapes to, I did not have a back-up plan for this system. I 
of course have created one and have the tapes ready for it, but that 
does not help us in the current situation. I still have two actions to 
try. </P>
<P>
1) move unit 1 of the pircs directory to another lun/slot and try to 
recover from there </P>
<P>
2) try a low level drive access program for set-up and configuration of 
drives. </P>
<P>
Normally this is used only at the factory (so the documentation tells 
me) so details on it's use are sketchy. I am in touch with SGI asking 
them for advise on it's use. Currently I am rebuilding another of the 9 
gig drives into a new unit 1 and will try to add this to the pircs 
drive set. This will be a last ditch attempt to at least recover 2/3's 
of the files (unlikely to be that high, but a theoretical possibility). 
While that drive is being created I am researching the above two 
options so that I have all the details I need for when I am in front of 
the computer. It seems one of the 9 gig units had a hardware level 
failture. This failure affected 2 other drives on the machine, but I 
seem to have recovered fully those two units. Unfortunately the drive 
that failed was unit 1 of 3 (the first of the set) and as such contains 
the file structure information needed to recover the file system. I 
will keep you up to date on the actions I am taking and the progress, 
if any. </P>
