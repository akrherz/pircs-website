<b>New Look</b>
<br>
<dd>
I am working on a new interface to the PIRCS intranet net which I hope will
be much cleaner and easier to use.  My goal is to make the page more usefull for
the PIRCS group as a location for examples and information.  
<a href=mailto:fils@iastate.edu"> Please provide me 
thoughts and suggestions.</a>
</dd>
<p>
<b>Do you use Excell?</b>
<br>
<dd>If you use Excell for Macintosh or Intell then you may be interested in a
set of math tools ($20.00 shareware) for Excell.  Look at 
<a href="http://www.octavian.com/mathdesc.html">http://www.octavian.com/mathdesc.html</a>
 for more information.

<b>New drive storage technology</b>
<br>
<dd>
Maxtor has 
<a href="http://www.news.com/News/Item/0,4,19350,00.html">
announced the release of a new hard drive at 11.5 Gigs</a> and 
<a href="http://www.news.com/News/Item/0,4,19189,00.html">Seagate has
announced a new breakthrough providing 10 to 20 times the storage capacity</a>
over current drive technology.
</dd>
<p>
<b>netCDF utilities installed.</b>
<br>
<dd>
I have installed the ncview program for netCDF files as well as GRADS for both 
SGI and Alpha.  Please note that the SGI version is 1.7 while the Alpha is 1.6, I 
can not get 1.7 for alpha, nor the source code for 1.7 to compile it.  If anyone can get
1.7 source I will gladly compile it.  1.7 is required for correct interfacing with 
netCDF.  Zekai, has resolved the netCDF <-> GRADS issue.  I am assembling a 
complete list of netCDF programs downloaded and isntalled and will place it under the 
netCDF reference on this page.
</dd>
<p>
<b>Cross compiling F90 and C</b>
<br>
<dd>
Chris Anderson, and I resolved a little issue with cross compiling F90 and C.  If your
main is in C then on the Alpha's you need to tell the F90 compiler that this is the case but
you do not need to on the SGI's, a line like:<br>
<font color="green">f90 myf90.f -o myprog myCmain.o </font><br>
will work fine on the SGI's though it will warn you that you have replaced the default f90
main with your own main (which you of course know, so I don't know why it tells you).
<br>
On neither machine did the C compile seem to want to cross compile to the f90 to produce 
a binary, if people know how to use the C compile to finish a cross compile I would be
interested to know and document it here.
<p>
<b>SMP Linux</b>
<dd>
IITAP is doing  work with shared memory parallel programs on Linux.  If you are interested in 
threaded programming this is a cheap and easy way to explore this programming style.
Information is available from the <a href="http://www.iitap.iastate.edu/linux">
Linux SMP page at IITAP</a>.
