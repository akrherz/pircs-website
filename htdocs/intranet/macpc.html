Both of these machines have <I>Microsoft Office, telnet, WWW clients 
and ftp clients</I> on them. <I>X-servers will also be located on these 
machines </I>eventually. The printers in room 3203 are already 
connected to these machines.</P>
<P>
Please note that you should keep copies of important data on disket as 
we do not back-up the internal disk drives on either the Mac or PC.</P>
<P>
If you have any software that you would like to see installed on these 
systems, please get in touch with Douglas Fils at 294-6196 or 
fils@iastate.edu and I will do what I can to help you.</P>
<P>
We have various <I>video conferencing solutions</I> available for both 
these machines, so if you are interested in these capabilities you 
sould just ask.</P>
