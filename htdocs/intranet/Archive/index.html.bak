    Wow, it's been a long time since I updateed these pages, I am going to 
    move them to the www.pircs.iastate.edu server and redo the intranet 
    system to be a bit more flexiable and easier to maintain.

    All the printing functions are ready to go from all the UNIX machines. 
    I need to check each one and make sure I am referencing the printer 
    correctly and it should be done. I haven't brought the color printer 
    down yet since I don't have anything to put it on, I may try and drag 
    another small table I have at IITAP over here for it. When I am done 
    and everything is the &quot;same&quot; on all the machines I will post 
    the finalized print commands. 
    <LI>
    The tape units are up and solid (tested) on pircsa1.agron.iastate.edu 
    as units rmt1h and rmt0h (there is a note on them to tell you which is 
    which). So you can use:<BR>
     tar cf /dev/rmt0h ./source<BR>
     Note in the man pages that on the DEC's now you can not use a command 
    like <BR>
     tar -fxv /dev/rmt0h<BR>
     there are restrictions on how and where to use - now. The man pages 
    are pretty good (for a change) on this. Also, mt works fine so<BR>
     mt -f /dev/rmt1h rewind<BR>
     and all the other mt commnads are operating as expected. 
    <LI>
    The server is up and running with NFS and all the compilers. It is 
    exported to maggie, pircsa0 and pircsa1 at /local/mnt/ppircs. Accounts 
    are being made and I will get these out.

NFS is up and running, I have a 26 gig volume exported to pircsa0 for 
testing and it is looking good.<BR>
 I will bring the printers and accounts up next and the compilers will 
be installed as well today. On that note I have not heard back form the 
comp cernter regarding compilers for the alpha's so I will get back in 
touch with them, it's been over a week now. </P>

Sorry for all the delays in providing updates here, it has been wild 
getting everything together plus not falling behind on my other 
projects. (I have of course fallen behind on the projects anyway) Here 
is the status of events, it looks to all soon be done and up. </P>

    Server is up and running for several days now. Drives are plexed 
    together and ready to go. 
    <LI>
    ftp is operational, I created ftp.pircs.iastate.edu as an alias 
    <LI>
    WWW is operational, I created www.pircs.iastate.edu as an alias 
    <LI>
    The 8mm drives are on pircsa1 (I will provide info on accessing them 
    there). I don't have the scsi cables to hook them directly to the 
    server at this time, so I attached them there so that they could be 
    used if needed. 
    <LI>
    I will bring the NFS and NIS systems on-line and then create the 
    mounting files for the computers. 
    <LI>
    print services will be brought up at the same time 
    <LI>
    expect accounts any day now.

    The memory has been added to both Alpha's. They are now at 160 megs 
    each (before system boot, which will eat into available space) 
    <LI>
    The return of top. Top was not on the DEC UNIX distribution, I found 
    this hard to believe but true. I locted the source of top, but it uses 
    heavy gnu make dependancies in the make routine, so I have just brought 
    over a top binary. There seems to be some trouble with ncurses and the 
    termcap entry file. I will keep people posted on this and get top into 
    the standard bin path on both these machines.

Some people have asked if they will always have to deal with changing 
passwords on all the different machines. Absolutely not. The server 
will run NIS (yellow pages) so you will be able to deal with 
centralized passwords and file systems, including home directories. I 
will provide more information on this as well as some easy mods to your 
dot files so that you don't have to worry if you are on the SGI's, 
alpha's or vincent machines. </P>

The accounts are ready (<B>no really, they are</B>) and I will bring

    The SGI's have a full set of Fortran and C/C++ compilers ready to go, 
    the Cosmo system is on the computers (I will put more in<FONT
     COLOR="#000000">fo in the WWW site) but the license has not been 
    installed, I will do that soon. Netscape and Java are also on these 
    machines for those interested. Also the SGI integrated dev environment 
    is also on these, a very nice debugging and performance analysis 
    package for C/C++ and Fortran. </FONT>
    <LI>
    <FONT COLOR="#000000">The DEC alpha's came with a C compiler but 
    not Fortran, I am talking with the comp center to see if there is a 
    site license we can g</FONT>et in on for that (as well as ncar 
    graphics and spyglass). Fortran binaries compiled on Vincent can be 
    ftp'ed to these machines and will run fine. 
    <LI>
    Pircsa0 has a 2 gig drive located at /local/mnt/scsi5, it can be used 
    by anyone for extra local computer space. Space is more limited at this 
    time on pircsa1, use df -k to watch this for the time being. 
    <LI>
    Office has been placed on the Windows and Mac machines in the room, 
    they are ready to be used, but I will need to install printer drivers 
    on them so they can see the (any) printer. 
    <LI>
    TCP/IP is conflicting with another machine on the Mac, so ethernet o it 
    is down. I will have to get this resolved (which will the 2nd time I 
    got a bad number for this room from the comp center) :(

    I am touch with both Mary Davis and Cathy Beckman at central stores. It 
    looks like we will get the chairs from Ames Stationers and the desks 
    from central stores.

    The alpha's are now networked. I have a 2 gig drive over here which I 
    will add to one of them and bring it on-line for people. 
    <LI>
    I will work up a user registration sheet for accounts. I will use this 
    to provide information on and records of accounts. I will use this to 
    then distribute accounts to PIRCS users so they can begin to work with 
    the machines. The server should show up this week, from the information 
    I have. 
    <LI>
    The Mac and PC are now set up. I will be placing x-hosting software on 
    both of these machine soon (I have this software ready to go). I will 
    fit both these systems out with as much software as I can and index 
    that information somewhere in www pages. I will do this the other 
    machines as well.

I am working up most of my notes here so that people will have a single

    The computers are coming on-line, I hope to have all 4 UNIX systems 
    running by the end of Monday 
    <LI>
    The printer is on-line with the SGI systems, hope to have it end of 
    Monday for Alpha's and soon for the Vincent system. It's ready for 
    Mac's and PC/Windows 95. Win 95 can talk AppleTalk so you can get to it 
    that way, I can show anyone how to do this if you haven't done it 
    before. 
    <LI>
    I am not setting the Mac and PC/Windows machine up first, but rather 
    last in the assumption the UNIX machines are of more interest. Please 
    let me know if this is wrong. 
    <LI>
    I can configure the color printer here at the start of this week as 
    well. 
    <LI>
    I am still working on getting desks. I also have some prices on new 
    desks, I will bring this over on Monday 
    <LI>
    The Alpha's came configured in such a way as they have almost no disk 
    space left over, I have a 2 gig drive I will bring over and may have a 
    1 gig that can be used for a while on these machines to solve this. 
    There may also be some &quot;intro&quot; files on the systems that may 
    be large and be removed.

<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Making user accounts</FONT><BR>
 There are a few things to keep in mind in reference to making user 
accounts on the systems. One is that if someone already has a Vincent 
computer account you should use their UID from Vincent for the UID on 
all the systems. You can get this from Vincent with the command: </P>
<P>
hesinfo username passwd <BR>
 For example:<BR>
 hesinfo fils passwd<BR>
 fils:*:1316:101:Douglas R Fils,89B Physics,(515) 294-6196,(515) 
292-0597,:/home/fils:/bin/tcsh<BR>
 This shows my vincent UID to be 1316. </P>
<P>
I will work up a detailed page on the steps to add users to the various 
machines, as well the the chlist additions for the vincent stations. 
Also, a common root passwd should be decided upon for the machines so 
that the popper people can be provided with this access. </P>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">NFS notes</FONT><BR>
 When the drives arrive and are installed, I will use a common mount 
point on all the NFS clients. Due to some restrictions with the mount 
point on vincent workstations (NFS mount points only allowed in /local) 
I am suggesting:<BR>
 /local/mnt/nfs0</P>
<P>
as the mount point on all the machines. This path can then be used in 
the code and it can be compiled on the SGI's, Alpha's, Vincent, etc and 
the path name will be common to all. I will sym link this on the O2000 
as well, so even it will be able to use this directory path. </P>
<P>
The mount command (must be executed as root) is then:<BR>
 mount -tnfs pricss0.geol.iastate.edu:/usr/people/pircs /local/mnt/nfs0<BR>
 <I>this is only an example, until the machine is here, I can't put the 
actual command</I> </P>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Printer notes</FONT><BR>
 The LaserJet 5 is currently named LaserJet 5, I will get this changed 
to something more like pircs_lj5 soon. When that is done I will put 
details here on adding printers and how to print to them. The SGI's are 
currently pointed at this printer, so the command <BR>
 lp -dlaserejt5 file<BR>
 will print to it. Note this is a SysV style lp system, not BSD style 
lpr system as most people at ISU are used to. I will install the BSD 
lpr package on the SGI's so both can be used. I will redo this section 
as the printer details get refined. </P>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">HINT marks</FONT><BR>
 As Prof. Arritt, has noted the only good benchmark is the program 
itself. I couldn't agree more, however, I have a high degree of respect 
for the HINT system developed at Ames Lab. As such I provide you a very 
early look at the results I have for machines like those being used by 
PIRCS. </P>
<P>
In addition to the common caveats related to benchmarks I provide these 
as well. </P>
<OL>
    <LI>
    The Alpha box does not have its full install of memory, this will 
    improve its performance, mostly in the later sections of this curve 
    (representing more complex operations). 
    <LI>
    The SGI systems are running a version of the program compiled for R4600 
    processors, not R5000 or R10000 cpu's. Their performance will improve 
    with native compiled code and the larger memory sizes we will run at. 
    <LI>
    The Origin listed here is a 200 running the R4600 compiled benchmark. 
    Not the 2000 model that will be coming. 
    <LI>
    The Mac and PC curves are from machines running under UNIX and not 
    MacOS or Windows 95. My experience shows that MacOS and Windows 95 will 
    not perform as well due to GUI overhead and inferior IO and memory 
    management routines. These curves should be considered 
    &quot;generous&quot; in that regard. 
    <LI>
    The vincent machine is a Dec 3000/300 with only 32 megs of memory.

<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">isofs image files</FONT><BR>
 As some data may be distributed in CD-ROM format, I will install the 
isofs program. This is a UNIX side program we are using to generate iso 
image files. Most all common CD-ROM writing software can read these 
format files. It allows for the creation of the CD-ROM 
&quot;image&quot; on the UNIX side which can help preserve proper path 
and file names and also helps to increase speed and reliability in the 
creation of CD-ROM's. Currently this program exists for the IRIX 
systems, I think I can compile it OK on the Dec UNIX systems though as 
well. </P>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Tape reference</FONT><BR>
 I will expand this section later with more details and information 
regarding reading, writing and tape manipulation. Multi-tape archives, 
moving forward and backward in multi-archive tapes, etc. </P>
<P>
For now I will note the following tapes as supported:<BR>
 </P>
<OL>
    <LI>
    4mm DDS 1 
    <LI>
    4mm DDS 2 
    <LI>
    8mm Exabyte (There is no such thing as just &quot;Exabyte&quot; 
    support, I will detail the exact Exabyte tape formats we can read and 
    write later) 
</OL>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">X server on the PC's and xhosting notes</FONT><BR>
 I have software for both the Windows and Mac computer to allow them to 
xhost to the UNIX machines. This can be done to Vincent as well, but 
the Dec Alpha's on vincent require that I create some /local/etc files 
to setup the permissions correctly (The ULTRIX boxes don't require 
these edits). </P>
<P>
I will configure these programs and place information here on their use 
as well as general information about xhosting here. </P>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Network topology</FONT><BR>
 I worked up a quick layout of how I am currently planning the room. 
Please ignore scaling aspects, this is only for location references. As 
always, this is your room, please let me know if you have any ideas or 
problems with my working plans. </P>
<P>
I will add details here regarding computer type, configuration, IP 
information, OS type, etc. It is because I do plan to put this 
information here that I strongly suggest making this page viewable to a 
restricted set of people and or domains. </P>
