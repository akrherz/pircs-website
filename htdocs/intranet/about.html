<h2>Hello</h2>
<p>
This Intranet page is still in the early stages but I wanted to get it 
out in front of people so they could get comments back to while I was working
in it, not after.
<p>
I have collected a great deal of information that I want to present to the
PIRCS group because I feal it would be of interest to the.  It is my hope that
this page will actually become usefull, not a common thing on the WWW I am 
sad to say.
<p>
More later<br>
