We are setting up a test hdf cgi interface system. With this people 
will be able to come in via the WWW client and view images and data 
sets from hdf files stored on the system. We will provide a search 
engine to locate various files.</P>
<P>
This is all real ruff right now, when I get the system moving a bit 
smoother I will polish this up and open it some more to get comments on 
the usefullness of all this.</P>
<P>
This basically provides now the ability for people to view hdf files 
and their content and then to download the binary file for their use 
sould they decide to.</P>

<FONT SIZE="4">HDF section</FONT><BR>
This section is dynamically created with a CGI script. It then makes 
calls to the hdf CGI script to allow for the browsing of hdf data files.</P>

<FONT SIZE="4">VRML section </FONT><BR>
The HDF data file format can be used to perform 2D and 3D 
visualizations. 3D visualizations can be saved in VRML (version 1.0) 
format for viewing on UNIX, Windows and PC with freely available 
software.</P>
