There are two printers in the PIRCS lab that are on the network. They 
are listed below along with the printer commands for the various 
machines.</P>

<FONT COLOR="green">LaserJet5M</FONT><BR>
 <FONT COLOR="green">pircs_lj5</FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="red">DEC UNIX: lpr -Ppircs_lj5 </FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="red">SGI's: lp -dpircs_lj5</FONT> </P>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="red">Vincent: lpr -Pah3203-lj5</FONT> <BR>
 NOTE: while this is fine for PS files, if you are sending text, like 
source code, the vincent system requires that it be converted before 
being sent to the printer. This is not a factor with the PIRCS machines 
but there is nothing I can do about it on Vincent. The system that can 
be used to print on Vincent is enscript found in the locker gnu. A 
print string might look something like:<BR>
 <FONT COLOR="red">enscript -Pah3203-lj5 file.txt.</FONT><BR>
 There are several nice options in enscript, including uping, line 
numbering and others that may be of interest to you. For example: <BR>
 <FONT COLOR="red">enscript --columns=2 --line-numbers --landscape 
-Pah3203-lj5 file.txt</FONT> <BR>
 Will print the file file.txt in landscape mode, 2 columns per page 
side by side and put line numbers down. </P>
<P>
Mac's: The printers are on the Desktop, or you can use the <I>Chooser</I>
 under the Apple menu. The printer is in zone Agronomy, as printer 
pircs_lj5 </P>
<P>
Windows: The printer discription has been made, you can select it from 
the print dialog box. </P>
