    <p><font class="text"><b>Attending:</b> Raymond Arritt, Jens
    Hesselbjerg Christensen, Michael Fox-Rabinovitz, Filippo
    Giorgi, Richard Jones, Jack Katzfey, Brent Lofgren, Daniel
    Luethi, Bennert Machenhauer, John McGregor, John Roads,
    Markku Rummukainen, Huqiang Zhang.
    <p>After introductions and a buffet dinner (courtesy of EPRI)
    Arritt gave an overview of the agenda including brief plans
    for analysis and publications from Experiment 1b. It was
    agreed that while consistency of the regional models with
    observed large-scale fields is a necessary point, the
    analysis should focus mainly on other issues.
    <p>Some preliminary comments were made on possible followup
    studies. Machehauer pointed out the need to address questions
    of predictability, requiring true &quot;climate&quot; runs
    (as opposed to specific episodes) or ensembles. Jones
    suggested a second integration with different initial
    conditions. It was generally agreed that followup studies
    such as sensitivity experiments should be done as individual
    efforts and not as a part of the PIRCS intercomparison.</font>
    <p><font class="subhead">Analysis of Experiment 1b</font>
    <p><font class="text">Discussion then turned to analysis of the 1993 
case. Most
    of the group felt that the analysis should focus on the
    hydrologic cycle. Katzfey suggested examination of the
    frequency distribution of precipitation, for which we could
    get some information from the 3 hourly data. Following from
    this suggestion, Roads recommended looking at extremes and
    distributions. Fox-Rabinovitz suggested looking at
    diagnostics related to the hydrologic cycle such as cloud
    fraction, precipitable water and vertically integrated
    fluxes. Katzfey pointed out the utility of satellite data
    (such as ISCCP) to provide cloud optical depth and cloud
    water for comparison to the models. Comparison of surface
    fluxes also was recommended. Jones suggested looking at the
    question of moisture recycling; i.e., the relative roles of
    evaporation versus horizontal moisture flux in producing
    precipitation. Roads suggested looking at the diurnal cycle
    of precipitation and its association with the low-level jet.
    <p>Rummakainen pointed out the importance of critical
    combinations of variables and variable extremes. It could be
    instructive to see whether regional models can produce these.
    Machenhauer noted that surface drying that has often been
    found in climate scenarios and suggested this could be
    examined.</font>
    <p><font class="subhead">Proposed PIRCS Experiment 
2</strong></font>
    <p><font class="text">The second major topic of discussion centered 
around
    possibilities for a future experiment or experiments. Roads
    presented a proposal for simulating the El Nino episode of
    1997-99. Impacts on Florida and California are of particular
    interest. The regional models could be embedded within a
    prediction instead of analysis. Ideally resolution should be
    25 km in order for the models to represent terrain effects in
    California, but this would almost certainly require a domain
    smaller than the continental U.S. Fox-Rabinovitz asked
    whether the models should use a free running land surface
    scheme or prescribed soil moisture. Christensen asked what
    criteria will be used for validation. The ENSO cycle is
    driven by the large scale, but are there additional aspects
    to be considered? How do we quantify how accurate regional
    models have to be?
    <p>Rummukainen asked about the source of driving data. Roads
    responded that this could be taken from analyses or from
    forecasts, e.g., short term seasonal predictions. Christensen
    asked whether an ensemble approach might be useful, while
    Fox-Rabinovitz asked what is meant by prediction mode. Roads
    responded that there are many ways of driving the regional
    models. We can do &quot;pure&quot; prediction as well as pure
    analysis, or any range between. Examples include analyses
    with observed SST, or predicted SST, etc. We could use
    prescribed SST and NCEP analysis, then compare with a
    prediction having some skill (e.g., IRI). McGregor asked
    whether an AMIP style approach could be useful.</p>
    <p>Giorgi pointed out the need to clarify the objective of
    the experiment and that Roads' proposal would fit an
    objective of seasonal prediction. We need to consider what is
    a natural followon from Experiment 1. The group could do a
    multiyear run, and look at other mesoscale effects (e.g.,
    topography, western U.S., winter) in more of a natural
    extension than seasonal prediction. The possibility of an
    enhanced CO<sub>2</sub> scenario was briefly discussed but it
    was decided that meaningful runs would have to be too long to
    be practical.
    <p>The topic of verification data for the 1993 experiment was
    briefly revisited. Fox-Rabinovitz mentioned that his group
    has run the 1993 experiment using their stretched grid model
    in data assimilation mode with 60 km resolution over the U.S.
    These results include comprehensive diagnostics and are
    available for use as verification. Roads agreed that this
    could be useful for the second paper and asked whether it is
    it better than the NCEP reanalysis. Fox-Rabinovitz replied
    that the stretched grid analyses are a bit better than the
    standard (coarser resolution) GEOS (not NCEP) analyses,
    according to his evaluation for summers of 1988 and 1993.
    Giorgi suggested comparing the 1988 and 1993 model-predicted
    precipitation to reanalysis precipitation. There was brief
    discussion of the ways in which reanalysis precipitation is
    affected by the &quot;spinup&quot; problem.
    <p>Roads said we need to ask what are people willing to do.
    Roads suggested reconsidering what data should be archived as
    the data volume can be a burden on some participants; for
    example, whether it might be sufficient to save monthly
    averages. Fox-Rabinovitz felt there is a clear need to save 6
    hourly values in order to resolve the diurnal cycle and
    mesoscale features. Arritt pointed out that data volume could
    be reduced by saving only certain levels and pre-computing
    some of the required quantities such as heights of standard
    pressure surfaces. Katzfey recommended we save and examine
    cloud fields (fraction, optical depth).</font>
    <p><font class="subhead">Stretched grid modeling</font>
    <p><font class="text">Fox-Rabinovitz presented an update on stretched 
grid
    modeling. His group is working on developing the stretched
    grid version of the new NASA/NCAR model. This version will be
    used for regional climate studies. Several groups are doing
    stretched grid modeling with about 3-4 groups aggressively
    involved. This could be a new component for PIRCS.
    Fox-Rabinovitz is running the model both in &quot;simulation
    mode&quot; and &quot;assimilation mode.&quot; For the PIRCS
    experiment, they are running in assimilation mode with data
    withheld over the U.S. He will submit the 1993 results for
    the PIRCS comparison.</font>
    <p><font class="subhead">NCAR Community Regional
    Climate Model</font>
    <p><font class="text">In the absence of Ruby Leung, Arritt briefly 
discussed
    plans for a possible regional modeling option within the NCAR
    MM5, presented at a meeting on 24 June 1999 at NCAR. The
    modified OSU land-surface scheme (similar to the Eta model)
    is being added to make MM5 more suitable for extended runs.
    Giorgi mentioned that the relatively simple standard MM5
    radiation scheme could be a problem as well as the land
    surface.</font>
    <p><font class="subhead">Geographical regions for
    Experiment 2</font>
    <p><font class="text">The group returned to recommendations for PIRCS 
Experiment
    2, focusing on the region or regions to be simulated. This
    was motivated by comments by Christensen that while the
    original PIRCS goals addressed aspects of interest to all,
    not just U.S. participants, the project seems to have
    progressed to a U.S. focus. This could discourage
    participation from groups outside of the U.S. Fox-Rabinovitz
    pointed out that modelers once were preoccupied with Indian
    monsoon and that now ENSO over the U.S. is considered an
    interesting event.
    <p>Christensen pointed out that the program needs overall
    scientific objectives and must also be of benefit to
    individual groups; do we learn anything new? We need to
    revisit what is the fundamental reason for doing
    intercomparisons and stress the new science. Giorgi felt that
    a natural next step is to do multi-year perfect boundary
    condition experiments and for this reason likes the 1997-99
    ENSO idea.
    <p>Arritt brought up the possibility of doing the ENSO for
    two regions. North America could be run as an extension of
    Experiment 1 with a second region being simulated for
    contrast. Giorgi asked what this region might be, and the
    possibility of Brazil was mentioned. Other regions were also
    mentioned. It was pointed out that there already lots of
    people doing regional climate simulations for East Asia.
    Africa was brought up as a possibility. After discussion, a
    consensus emerged that South America would probably be the
    most appropriate region to simulate in addition to (or
    instead of) North America. This is partly because there are
    some similarities to North America (e.g., the low-level jet
    as a frequent mesoscale feature) and data from other studies
    could be used for validation. Christensen reiterated the need
    to keep in mind the ultimate goal of the project and that it
    is hard to use separate simulations as an ensemble. We could
    approach the two regions as 2a and 2b. Giorgi pointed out the
    need to make contacts with other investigators and
    institutions; e.g, Carlos Nobre, PACS, IAI. Roads mentioned
    funding and suggested we collaborate more closely with AMIP.
    <p>Arritt volunteered to summarize the discussions into a
    plan for PIRCS Experiment 2, with feedback from the rest of
    the Iowa State group and from the PIRCS community at large.</font>
    <p><font class="subhead">Next PIRCS meeting</font>
    <p><font class="text">The topic of the next PIRCS meeting was brought 
up. The
    most likely venues are the AGU Fall Meeting in San Francisco
    (December 1999) or the AMS annual meeting in Long Beach
    (January 2000). Some felt we should meet at both places. </font><p>
