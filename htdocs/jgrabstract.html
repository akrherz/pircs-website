<CENTER>ABSTRACT</CENTER>
<P>
A description is given for the first simulation experiment 
and output archives of the Project to Intercompare Regional 
Climate Simulations (PIRCS).  Initial results from simulations of 
the summer 1988 drought over the central U.S. indicate that 
limited-area models forced by large-scale information at the lateral 
boundaries are able to reproduce bulk temporal and spatial 
characteristics of meteorological fields.  In particular, the 500 hPa height field's time average and temporal variability are generally well simulated by all participating models.
<P>
Model simulations of precipitation episodes vary depending on the scale of the relevant dynamical forcing.  Organized synoptic-scale precipitation systems are simulated deterministically in that precipitation occurs at close to the same time and location as observed (though the amounts may vary from the observations).  Episodes of mesoscale and convective precipitation are represented in a more stochastic sense, with less precise agreement in temporal and spatial patterns. 
<P>
Simulated surface energy fluxes near the FIFE region show broad similarity with FIFE observations in their temporal evolution and time average diurnal cycle. Inter-model differences in mid-day Bowen ratio tend to be closely associated with precipitation differences.  Differences in daily maximum temperatures are also linked to the Bowen ratio differences, indicating strong local, surface influence on this field.  Although some of the models have bias with respect to the FIFE observations, they all tend to reproduce the synoptic variability of observed daily maximum and minimum temperatures.
