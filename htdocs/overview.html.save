PIRCS is a community-based project, organized under the auspices of Iowa 
State University, to intercompare regional models run in climate 
mode.
PIRCS consists of a series of collaborative intercomparison
experiments using different mesoscale models to simulate the climate of 
the
Central US for a 60-day period beginning 15 May during the drought year of
1988 (Exp. 1a) and a follow-on 60-day experiment for the Midwest flood
period beginning 1 June 1993 (Exp. 1b).  These are periods and a region
that the GEWEX Numerical Experimentation Panel has targeted for simulation
by regional-scale models.  These simulations provide an opportunity to
evaluate local and remote influences on the water cycle of the Central US.
In addition, Expt. 1a emphasizes thermal and dynamical processes and is
intended to provide an initial comparison of how well regional models
represent aggregate characteristics of weather events in a simulation long
enough to include many such events (i.e., to simulate regional climate)
during a period when surface thermal forcing within the domain is large 
and
precipitation and latent-heat effects are minimal.  Expt. 1b emphasizes
processes of the water cycle and will examine strengths and weaknesses of
parameterizations of precipitation.<br><br>

Model simulations are performed by the participating research
groups at their own expense. PIRCS provides management of
datasets, including initial conditions, boundary conditions, and simulated
results, using procedures and protocols consistent with other large
intercomparison projects.
