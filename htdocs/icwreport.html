<A NAME="welcome"><FONT class="subhead">Welcoming Remarks by Dr. 
Takle</FONT></A>
<P><font class="text">
The group was welcomed on behalf of IITAP, Iowa 
State University, and the Department of Geological and Atmospheric 
Sciences by Dr. Gene Takle, IITAP Thrust Area Coordinator for 
Environmental and Earth Sciences (EES). He outlined the general goals 
of IITAP including the application of science (physics) to 
environmental (meteorological) problems, and the training of developing 
countries' scientists. He then gave the mission statement of the EES of 
IITAP which is:</font>

   <p><blockquote><font class="text3"> <I>To address basic and applied 
problems</I> in 
environmental
and earth sciences by use of basic physical science 
principles, and to use this mechanism for creating and
expanding partnerships with scientists from developing
countries to enhance local science infrastructure.</blockquote></font>

<P>
Dr. Takle noted that there are many environmental 
problems that are shared by both developed and developing countries 
where cooperation could help solve these problems. Also he noted that 
there are many unique databases in developing countries that local 
scientists have access to and that could be shared with scientists in 
developed countries. An institution like IITAP could help train 
scientists as they analyze these databases. The importance of trained 
scientists in providing local solutions to environmental problems and 
to provide guidance to local policymakers in their decision making, was 
also mentioned.
<P>
Takle then noted that in the above context the 
initial thrust activities of the earth and environmental sciences 
division would be regional-scale climate modeling, studies in 
shelterbelt turbulence, and the development of an electronic classroom. 
The main goal of the regional- climate modeling effort would be to 
improve the status of regional-scale meteorological models and to 
promote their use by developing countries for solving environmental 
problems. It was also made clear that the proposed activities were not 
intended to be performed exclusively by or at Iowa State.
<P>
Takle then noted that the main mission of the 
workshop was to design a first experiment for the proposed 
regional-climate model intercomparison. Dr. Martin Jischke (President 
of Iowa State and UCAR trustee) was then introduced to the workshop. He 
made a few general welcoming remarks and gave a brief historical 
background about the origins of IITAP. He also noted that this was the 
first technical workshop to be hosted by IITAP. Jischke then introduced 
the Keynote speaker Dr. Richard Anthes (Director of NCAR/UCAR).</font>
<P>
<A NAME="keynote"><FONT class="subhead">Keynote address by Dr. Richard 
Anthes</FONT></A>
<P><font class="text">
<A NAME="keynote">Anthes started off by noting that 
climate is much more than 30 year averages of monthly mean temperatures 
and precipitation. It also includes a description of the frequency and 
intensity of extreme events such as hurricanes, droughts, floods, 
thunderstorms, and prolonged hot and cold spells. He also noted that 
climate includes a description of the temporal and spatial variability 
of climate variables. In short; climate is the integral over time of 
the weather, and in order to know the integral (climate) we have to 
know how the integrand (weather) behaves.</A>
<P>
<A NAME="keynote">Anthes then presented a schematic 
of the components that are represented in 3-D climate models. He noted 
that the large-scale factors that determine the earth's climate (the 
radiation balance and the rotation of the earth) are included in 1-D 
and 2-D climate models that are adequate for describing the gross 
features of the earth's climate. The 3-D global models do a good job 
describing the large-scale spatial and temporal structure of the 
climate, but their coarse resolution is not adequate for describing 
climate on scales finer than a few hundred kilometers. Since 
information about climate is needed at these scales, motivation is 
provided for regional- scale climate modeling.</A>
<P>
<A NAME="keynote">He then gave some hypotheses that 
form the basis for regional climate modeling, which were:</A>
<UL>
    <LI class="text">
    <A NAME="keynote">a) the climate at a point is 
    determined by interactions between large-scale atmospheric circulations 
    and mesoscale physical processes. This interaction is 2-way, but</A>
    <LI class="text">
    <A NAME="keynote">b) down-scale interaction is 
    most important;</A>
    <LI class="text">
    <A NAME="keynote">c) mesoscale processes are 
    determined by i) internal instabilities in the large-scale flow and ii) 
    mesoscale variations in terrain and land-use; </A>
    <LI class="text">
    <A NAME="keynote">d) if the large-scale is 
    known then mesoscale models can improve significantly the prediction of 
    climate, since they can represent these instabilities and finer-scale 
    variations.</A>
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="keynote">He concluded that if GCMs predict 
the large-scale well then mesoscale models may be embedded via a 1-way 
interaction to add mesoscale detail to regional climates. However, a 
cautionary note was added that if the GCM does not do well at the 
large-scale, then the mesoscale model will produce a poor or useless 
simulation.</A>
<P>
<A NAME="keynote">Anthes then showed some results 
from western U.S. January climate simulations with MM4 (60 km grid) 
embedded in an R-15 GCM (Giorgi and Bates, (1989)). The results showed 
the refinements in the structure of precipitation that were possible 
using the mesoscale model. He also showed some recent work of Sousounis 
and Fritsch (1994) regarding the aggregate influence of the Great Lakes 
on that region's climate. Their modeling work showed that the Great 
Lakes tend to modify the large-scale flow by producing a regional low 
near the surface (&quot;a lake-aggregate circulation&quot;) and an 
anticyclonic circulation near 700 mb.</A>
<P>
<A NAME="keynote">Anthes then demonstrated the 
ability of mesoscale models to capture extreme events such as a rapidly 
intensifying Atlantic cyclone by showing video of MM5 simulations of 
the January 4, 1989 ERICA IOP 4 storm (Reed et al. (1994)). The video 
was very interesting and it included a demonstration of the sensitivity 
of the model simulations of the storms intensity and life-cycle to the 
inclusion of friction, horizontal diffusion and surface physical 
processes.</font></A>
<P>
<A NAME="potter"><FONT class="subhead">Global climate model 
intercomparison; AMIP experience</FONT></A>
<P><font class="text">
<A NAME="potter">The next speaker was Jerry Potter 
from Lawrence Livermore who shared with the workshop the Program for 
Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison (PCMDI) experiences with 
the Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP). The purpose of 
AMIP is to document model performance under realistic conditions, 
facilitate model diagnosis and validation, and provide a benchmark for 
sensitivity studies. The first experiment that was conducted to help 
achieve the three goals was a simulation of the global climate between 
1979- 1988 with prescribed monthly mean SST's, sea ice, CO2, and the 
solar constant. Potter noted that this was basically an &quot;El 
Nino&quot; experiment since the overwhelming climate signal 
(perturbation) in that period was the El Nino of 1982-1983. He also 
stated that they were planning to extend the simulations 6 more years 
through 1994. After the simulations were done by the groups involved 
(30 major climate modeling groups in the world) an in-depth analysis 
was to be performed via diagnostic sub-projects. Part of the AMIP 
experience was that many of the initial simulations had to be redone 
because many of the variables required by the subprojects had not been 
saved, or had been saved too infrequently. He stressed the importance 
of careful planning in deciding what variables should be saved and at 
what frequency (&quot;Save as much as you can!&quot; was the catch cry).</A>
<P>
<A NAME="potter">Potter noted that Lawrence 
Livermore had offered computer time to some of the modeling groups 
involved and that the need for ensemble runs had placed constraints on 
the resolution at which the models could be run. He also noted that 50% 
of their staff time (20 scientist/computer technicians) was devoted to 
AMIP, and as an example he stated the case of one of their staff who 
had spent a year documenting all the models involved in the experiment 
(T.J. Phillips, (1994)). Potter noted the support that the DOE and 
WGNE/WCRP had given AMIP.</A>
<P>
<A NAME="potter">The most important aspect of AMIP 
has been the identification of systematic errors amongst the models. As 
an example Potter noted that diagnosis of the tropics revealed 
anomalously low short-wave radiation absorption in all the model 
atmospheres.</A>
<P>
<A NAME="potter">The data structure had to be 
self-describing for atmospheric modeling use, and they had to design an 
interface between the database (of model results) and a diagnostic 
library which included visualization tools capable of handling various 
formats (netCDF, GRIB, HDF, DPS, and GraDS). They also have a Mosaic 
home-page (URL http://www-pcmdi.llnl.gov/) where people will be able to 
extract data to their site or perform some calculations with some 
variables at data central. He noted that consistency among models as to 
units used and levels at which output was available should be agreed 
upon, or procedures to handle differences should be sorted out before 
any simulations are done. Storage limitations and data access could 
also be a problem (model histories- 6 hr state of model = 100 GB per 
run). They have a facility for mass storage with a capacity of 20 
Terabytes of storage at data central which is needed to handle the data 
efficiently. The analyses used for validation of the simulations will 
come from NMC, NASA, NRL, and ECMWF analyses.</A>
<P>
<A NAME="potter">A list of some of the subprojects 
was then given. They could basically be divided into 3 categories 
involving the study of processes such as cloud radiative forcing, 
regional climates, and phenomena such as blocking. The support of these 
sub-projects was one of the tasks assigned to AMIP management. Other 
tasks assigned were communication with the groups (newsletters), 
quality control of the analyses and model output, and the organization 
of conferences and workshops. The importance of quality control of the 
model output and the need for it to be converted to standard format 
could not be understated. Finally, he noted that it was important this 
intercomparison was not meant to be a &quot;beauty contest&quot; among 
the models. A reference for the AMIP project was given as Gates, 
(1992).</font></A>
<P>
<A NAME="chouinard"><FONT class="subhead">Mesoscale forecast model 
intercomparison; COMPARE experience</FONT></A>
<P><font class="text">
<A NAME="potter">The next speaker was Clement 
Chouinard of the Canadian Atmospheric Environment Service group that 
organized the first case of the Comparison Of Mesoscale Prediction And 
Research Experiments (COMPARE) project, which was designed to compare 
the performance of mesoscale models in forecasting synoptic events such 
as maritime cyclogenesis. The objectives of COMPARE are to 
&quot;propose and perform experiments in a collaborative manner to 
further understanding and predictive capability at the mesoscale&quot;, 
to &quot;identify important issues of mesoscale research and prediction 
that may be addressed by numerical experimentation&quot;, and &quot;to 
establish a testbed of representative mesoscale cases using raw data, 
assimilation systems and analyses of the highest possible quality&quot;.</A>
<P>
<A NAME="potter">The following scientific issues at 
the mesoscale have been identified: </A>
<UL>
    <LI class="text">
    <A NAME="potter">a) assessment of mesoscale 
    forecast quality, and the identification of common strengths and 
    weaknesses of the models and any systematic errors at the regional 
    scale; </A>
    <LI class="text">
    <A NAME="potter">b) clarification of the 
    importance of the influence of LBC's on forecast quality;</A>
    <LI class="text">
    <A NAME="potter">c) evaluation of mesoscale 
    predictability in terms of LBC specification, data density and 
    assimilation methods, synoptic situation and the specification of 
    LBC's;</A>
    <LI class="text">
    <A NAME="potter">d) classification of impact of 
    model characteristics, such as horizontal and vertical resolution, 
    numerical methods, physical parameterizations etc. on forecast quality; 
    and </A>
    <LI class="text">
    <A NAME="potter">e) identification of any 
    components missing from existing models.</A>
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="potter">Chouinard then described the set 
of standard procedures and methodology for producing the analyses that 
would be used to drive the models. A minimum frequency of 6 hours was 
to be used for the data assimilation cycle. Analyses were to be 
provided for at least the 24 hour period up to the initial forecast 
time. The analyzed data were to be formatted on 2 regular lat/lon 
grids, the first being on a 1 degree global grid, the 2nd being 
&quot;semi- hemispheric&quot; at 0.5 degrees. They also recommended 
that the models should be run at the highest possible resolution 
compatible with the data density. Minimum requirements for vertical 
resolution at which data to be supplied to the models was set at 25 hPa 
between 1000 and 100 hPa, plus the analyzed mandatory levels above 100 
hPa. Values of p-s, z-s, u-10m, v-10m, T-2m, q-2m coherent with the 
data assimilation procedure were also provided along with a coherent 
set of surface geophysical fields such as SST, z0, albedo, 
soil-moisture, ice-cover etc, and participants were highly recommended 
to use them for their simulations. Some of the guidelines for the 
participation were to insist that the most recent version of models be 
used, and that the global and regional data fields used to drive the 
models be consistent between models so as to allow for a good 
comparison of the LBC driven and LBC free approaches. </A>
<P>
<A NAME="potter">The first COMPARE case was based 
on a marine cyclogenesis event from CASP (Canadian Atlantic Storms 
Project). Analyses were prepared using the RPN/CMC regional data 
assimilation system driven by NMC global analyses. A description of 
these techniques is given Chouinard et al. (1994). They produced a 
participation package consisting of an analysis tape; reading and 
decoding software; ECMWF's documentation of the GRIB format; a 
tape-reading guide; a description of suggested algorithms for 
interpolation and relations between thermodynamic and moisture 
variables; and a questionnaire on attributes of the participants 
models. Chouinard noted that an important aspect of the first 
experiment was to standardize procedures so as to facilitate the 
running of future experiments. He then described the set of proposed 
simulations that was to make up the first experiment. These were 
basically sensitivity tests to resolution and initial and lateral 
boundary conditions. </A>
<P>
<A NAME="potter">Chouinard then presented some 
results from the first project experiment, and noted the achievements 
thus far of COMPARE. The evaluation of the results of 11 modeling 
groups has been completed and presented at a workshop, they developed a 
software package to verify the forecasts against a set of 
quality-controlled observations and analyses, and consolidated all the 
results from the mesoscale model runs into a database which was 
distributed, along with visualization software to an independent 
evaluation group, and then to each participant. </A>
<P>
<A NAME="potter">Finally he noted that it had taken 
5 years to get to this stage, they had many problems with data exchange 
and had to validate, separately at least 100 experiments (visual 
inspection, they had a staff of 4.) </A>
<P>
<A NAME="potter">Federico Mayor, Director-General 
of UNESCO, then briefly addressed the workshop. A transcript of that 
address is included in </A><A HREF="#mayor"
 NAME="potter">Appendix A</A><A NAME="potter">. Mayor made these three 
points: (1) we often talk about applied science, but basic science is 
also very significant: &quot;there is no applied science if there is no 
science to apply!&quot; (2) National politicians and ministers need 
more scientific input for decision making and these scientific elements 
must be presented in an understandable way. (3) Thirty thousand Ph.D. 
scientists from sub-Sahelian Africa are now working in developed 
countries, where they have better opportunities to continue their 
research. UNESCO is trying to reverse this trend by bringing scientists 
from advanced countries to the south for periods of 2-3 months to 
facilitate rapid transfer of technology. </A></FONT>
<P>
<FONT class="subhead">Climate needs of developing 
countries (Semazzi)</font></A>
<P><font class="text">
The next speaker was Frederick 
Semazzi (North Carolina State) who talked about the climate needs of 
developing countries and some interesting work relating to aspects of 
African climate. Semazzi first noted the hierarchy of climate scales 
which are important to Africa ranging from the continental to watershed 
scales. He presented some observational results from Nicholson (1986) 
which showed rainfall departures over Africa for the periods 1950 - 
1959 and 1968 - 1973. These results seemed to suggest that there were 2 
modes for rainfall anomalies in Africa, the first where central Africa 
is drier than normal, and the regions north and south are wetter than 
normal; and the second where central Africa is wetter than normal and 
the other regions are drier than normal. He then showed some GCM 
results from simulated years within these periods that agreed 
qualitatively with the observations (Semazzi et al., (1994a), and 
Semazzi et al. (1994b))</A>
<P>
Semazzi then discussed the work 
of Owen et al. (1988) about seasonal forecasts of Sahelian rainfall 
made with the UKMET GCM, and the work of Semazzi et. al. (1993) with a 
nested regional model (inside CCM1) in trying to get more detail in 
historical seasonal simulations of Sahelian rainfall. He described the 
urgent need for seasonal forecasts since drought in Africa often means 
famine in the afflicted areas. He also talked about the work of the 
Drought Monitoring Center in Nairobi, and how mesoscale models might 
help in decision making with the Qattarra hydroelectric project in 
Egypt. There is a plan to fill the Qattar depression with water from 
the Mediterranean via a canal. Electricity would be generated by the 
flow of water through the canal. This flow would be sustained because 
of the intense evaporation of water off the newly created lake due to 
the extremely arid surroundings of the lake and its shallowness. 
Mesoscale models could be useful in the planning of this project since 
they could provide estimates of evaporation off the lake under the new 
mesoscale wind regime. He then talked briefly about how vegetation 
changes in the Amboseli National Park of Kenya had been affected by a 
prolonged wet spell, which had raised the water table enough to reach 
the roots of existing trees. Since the groundwater was highly saline, 
the trees died out. </A>
<P>
Semazzi then discussed the needs 
of African scientists and institutions if they wished to take advantage 
of advances in climate and mesoscale modeling. The basic requirements 
were computing power, maintenance, telecommunications and the 
associated infrastructure, observational data and qualified personnel. 
He then went on to discuss the modes for enhancing opportunities in 
regional climate modeling in developing countries, such as the research 
mode and a semi-operational mode. This semi-operational mode, he 
envisioned, would be a clearing house for mature climate modeling 
research products, and would be useful in developing a coordinated 
strategy in minimizing overlap between research at the continental, 
regional and watershed scales.</A>
<P>
After the talk there was a brief 
discussion of the negative impact on scientific research in developing 
countries arising from the multi-tiered data cost structuring policies 
now being adopted by some countries.</font></A>
<P>
<A NAME="witold"><FONT class="subhead">Hydrological considerations for 
regional models (Krajewski)</FONT></A>
<P><font class="text">
Witold Krajewski (hydrologist 
from the University of Iowa), the next speaker, talked about hydrologic 
considerations at continental, regional and finer scales including 
issues relating to streamflow.</A>
<P>
Krajewski started off by 
mentioning that they were working with NASA under the TRMM validation 
program. This program has a goal of extracting rainfall rate estimates 
from both satellite and ground radar returns. Selection of algorithms 
to be used with the ground radar data is made through an 
intercomparison of candidate methods. This framework is similar to the 
proposed intercomparison of the mesoscale model discussed herein. 
Krajewski then noted that the main characteristic of observations of 
hydrologic parameters (e.g. rain rates and radar reflectivity) were 
their tremendous variability, and that the major statistical assumption 
used in analysis (e.g. developing regression relationships) is 
stationarity. He also noted that variability in rainfall pales in 
comparison to the variability in hydraulic conductivity (which is a 
function of soil-moisture, which is itself highly variable - there are 
order-of-magnitude differences in conductivity between wet and dry 
soils, and sandy and clayey soils). Fortunately over time and space, 
nature integrates out much of this variability and streamflow is a 
measure of this integral. He then demonstrated how streamflow reflects 
long term trends in precipitation by showing spring precipitation and 
summer streamflow autocorrelations. He also noted the differences in 
variability in streamflows for drought and flood periods.</A>
<P>
Krajewski then showed some 
composite maps of temperature and precipitation correlations with 
summer soil-moisture levels based on the work of Konstantine 
Georgakakos and his colleagues at the Hydrologic Research Center in San 
Diego. Their work demonstrates the importance of soil moisture in the 
top two metre zone in controlling summer flooding in the Midwestern 
basins. metre zone He then showed some scattergrams of precipitation 
versus moisture convergence, evaporation and precipitation recycling 
for the Midwest, and he pointed out the location of summer of 1993 on 
these scattergrams. The results indicated that July 93 was an outlier 
in terms of precipitation and moisture convergence, but not in terms of 
evaporation and percent recycled moisture. (These results were from 
Allen Bradley, a hydrologist at the University of Iowa.)</A>
<P>
Krajewski noted that an important 
feature of mesoscale model validation in terms of the hydrological 
cycle is that the models must preserve the statistical character of 
precipitation variability across a range of scales. One statistical 
feature important for development of parameterizations of the 
hydrologic components of the climate models is a strong linear 
relationship between mean areal rainfall and fractional area covered by 
rain. A similar relationship holds in time. He then showed some 
scattergrams and linear regressions from GATE I and GATE II showing the 
relationship between area averaged rain rate and fractional area 
coverage.</A>
<P>
He then talked about the River 
Forecast Service (RFS) extended (1-3 month) streamflow predictions. He 
demonstrated, based on work by Georgakakos, quantitative benefits from 
operating water resources systems if long term streamflow forecasts are 
available.</A>
<P>
References given were Guetter and 
Georgakakos (1993) and Roads et al. (1994). </A>
<P>
Krajewski's talk was the last of 
the formal presentations. Less formal discussions concerning the 
objectives of the regional climate model intercomparison, and the 
design of the initial experiment with consideration of space and time 
domains, initial and lateral boundary conditions, surface physics, 
convective and radiation schemes followed. Practical issues relating to 
verification, what variables ought to be saved, standardization of 
reporting procedures, and funding sources were also discussed. </FONT></A>

<A NAME="design"><B><FONT class="subhead">Experiment Design</FONT></B></A>
<P>
<FONT class="subhead">Mission and Action Statements</FONT></A>
<P><font class="text">
Dr. Bill Gutowski (Geological and 
Atmospheric Sciences Department, Iowa State University) then led the discussion 
of the <a href="./mission.html">project mission</a> and a set of action 
statements.

<P>
The mission statement adopted was 
&quot;to advance the status of regional climate modeling by evaluating 
the strengths and weaknesses of current models and their component 
procedures through systematic, comparative simulations&quot;. 
The four action statements were: 

<ol>
<li class="text"> for participants in Project to Intercompare Regional 
Climate 
Simulations (PIRCS - suggested name for the project) to actually 
perform the experiments, 
<li class="text"> to provide straightforward access for 
developing countries scientists to the datasets produced for the 
project by the participants, 
<li class="text"> to develop collaboration between 
modeling groups and researchers in developing countries who wish 
greater involvement in regional climate modeling, and 
<li class="text"> to coordinate 
its activities with related international programs occurring under the 
auspices of the WMO and the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization.<p>
</ol>
In the general discussion that 
followed the following points were made (many of the points raised 
related to the scope of the participation):
<P>

<uL>
    <LI class="text">
    Need for well organized 
    strategy for the comparison was stressed. 
    <LI class="text">
    Use first experiment to 
    establish procedures, infrastructure.
    <LI class="text">
    Are we more concerned with 
    intermodel comparisons, or within-model comparisons which are more like 
    sensitivity studies? 
    <LI class="text">
    Consider a subproject with a 
    GCM participant. 
    <LI class="text">
    Include a variable resolution 
    global model - but it was argued that there might be a problem with 
    providing global analyses, and others argued that emphasis should be on 
    limited area regional models, since there was an interest on LBC 
    effects. </A>
    <LI class="text">
    Exclude statistical 
    downscaling techniques. 
</uL>
<P>
There was some discussion as to 
the name (acronym) of this experiment. It was noted that the current 
title (Regional-scale climate model intercomparison project) doesn't 
specify limited area domain models. It was suggested to leave out MIP 
since this implied connection with AMIP. PIRCS seemed to be the early 
favorite.</A>
<P>
It was suggested that the group 
encourage non-modelers to utilize the sets of model output generated in 
the form of subprojects a la AMIP. This would also be consistent with 
IITAP goals.</FONT></A>
<P>
<A NAME="giorgi"><FONT class="subhead">Scientific 
Objectives</FONT></A>
<P><font class="text">
The first discussion period was 
led by Filipo Giorgi (Climate and Global Dynamics division of NCAR) and 
this involved the setting of scientific objectives of this effort. 
After some time these were prioritized, as many people felt that the 
experiment should be as focused as possible, at least initially.</A>
<P>
Giorgi listed some general 
scientific objectives within the regional climate modeling community. 
These were </A>
<UL>
    <LI class="text">
    to improve the spatial 
    resolution of simulated climates. This would help bridge the scale gap 
    with impact models. </A>
    <LI class="text">
    to study the effects of local 
    forcings/feedbacks on regional and local climates. </A>
    <LI class="text">
    to test and develop physical 
    parameterizations for high resolution GCMs. </A>
    <LI clas="text">
    to test the importance of 
    resolution in the simulation of regional climates </A>
    <LI class="text">
    to provide a framework for 
    pilot coupling studies:</A>
    <UL>
        <LI class="text">
        model coupling (regional,

</UL>
<P>
Scientific questions that Giorgi 
thought ought to be answered in this effort were suggested and were 
prioritized as follows:</A>
<P>

<UL>
    <LI class="text">
    How do regional models 
    represent the individual and aggregated characteristics of synoptic 
    events in climate mode where simulations are long [i.e., long enough to 
    include many events] and continuous with driving conditions similar to 
    GCM nesting? </A>

were</A>
<UL>
    <LI class="text">

    <LI class="text">
    What differences are there 
    between continuous runs and those that are constantly reinitialized? </A>
</UL>
<P>
This list prompted much 
discussion and many points were raised about the first experiment and 
project in general, some of which were not resolved. Listed below are 
some of these points.</A>
<P>

<UL>
    <LI class="text">
    Can we show that there is 
    value added to the predictions of Global Climate models, and if so is 
    it worth the effort? In this regard it was noted that summer 1993 was a 
    case where global models did poorly in positioning the areas of high 
    rainfall, but higher resolution models such as the NGM did well. 
    Arguing against this was that some people thought that this would place 
    too much importance on the cumulus parameterization schemes in showing 
    up differences between the models. </A>
    <LI class="text">
    We should keep the 
    experimental design and proposed model modifications simple, at least 
    initially.</A>
    <LI class="text">
    Should we do a wintertime 
    season for a location where there exists a lot of variation in the 
    topography?</A>
    <LI class="text">
    Daniela Jacob ()related the 
    European experience with regional climate models, she noted that all 
    the models gave similar results and performed adequately in the winter, 
    whereas they still looked similar in the summer but performed poorly. </A>
    <LI class="text">
    It was argued that feedbacks 
    should be as simplified as possible. </A>
    <LI class="text">
    Should the simulation domain 
    include ocean bodies? (yes) </A>
    <LI class="text">
    Are we interested in seasonal 
    simulations or predictions? How about interannual predictions, i.e., if 
    BC's contain an El Nino signal, does the regional model produce a 
    &quot;local El Nino response&quot;? </A>

    What is ISU/IITAP prepared to 
    do? Able to do?</A>

<P><font class="text">
The last discussion session of 
the Thursday was led by Jens Hesselbjerg Christensen (Danish 
Meteorological Institute) and during this session it was decided what 
the domain and simulation period would be.</A>
<P>
The first experiment, designated 
1a, was decided to be a simulation of the summer 1988 drought over the 
central United States. This had the advantage of overlapping with the 
AMIP simulation period. Another potential experiment involving the 
simulation of the 1993 summer, when flooding occurred over much of the 
same region, was given the designation 1b.</A>
<P>
Other possibilities discussed 
were </A>
<P>

<UL>
    <LI class="text">
    Wintertime western U.S. 
    (topographic forcing).</A>
    <LI class="text">
    Europe 92 drought.</A>
    <LI class="text">

    (drought) contrasted with monsoon of 88 (normal) (India).</A>
    <LI class="text">

    America.</A>
    <LI class="text">
    East Asia monsoon of 1994.</A>
    <LI class="text">
    1993 summer whole US: this 
    would include both a drought (SouthEast) and a flood (Midwest).</A>
</UL>
<P>
One of the reasons for choosing 
1a and 1b over N. America was the availability of observations for 
validation. But it was argued that in future experiments the same 
arguments would be used against any experiments with simulation domains 
in developing countries. Therefore the participants were urged to 
seriously consider such a prospect for the second experiment.</A>
<P>
It was suggested that experiments 
be done using both ECMWF and NMC analyses in order to address the issue 
of noise in LBC's. Given the computing limitations, it was suggested 
that the internal domain be 70 (lon) x 60 (lat) x 20 (vertical - max) 
with an extended grid of 10 grid points along each lateral boundary. 
The resolution would be 50 or 60 km. Details of the exact boundaries 
were left to be decided by someone with a map of the proper projection 
and calculator.</A>

        possibly geopotential heights. Discussion then centered on agreed ways

        The group could not agree

        Analysis to be done on 
        pressure levels (every 25 mb), then interpolated to sigma levels if 
        necessary. There was concern that information, especially boundary

        This was left as a 
        decision up to the modelers? But the general concept of the inner 
        &quot;free or analysis&quot; domain would be 70 x 60, with the extended 
        &quot;forcing domain&quot; to be (90 x 80) or at least some constraints 
        be imposed on the thickness of the &quot;sponge or relaxation&quot; 
        layer; i.e., we want to specify a minimum free zone but place an outer 
        bound on the extended domain. (Exception - regional spectral model). It 
        was suggested that the convective and radiation schemes in the models 
        be left as they are (for the first experiment), but one group was 
        willing to test out an excellent radiation scheme if it were available.</A>

<A NAME="verify"><FONT class="subhead">Verification

<P><font class="text">
This discussion was led by 
Clement Chouinard. The first point he made was that thought had to put 
into our objectives so we could match model output to these. Here it 
was decided that we wanted to show finer detail than is currently 
realized by GCMs, and that moisture, heat and energy budgets would be 
key diagnostic variables.</A>
<P>
Output variables could be 
classified as dynamical (u,v,q,T,p,ql) and physical (fluxes). Averages 
of these quantities could be sent to ISU/IITAP for analysis, but 
histories could be saved at each institution. Hourly histories for 
surface budget calculations could also be sent to ISU/IITAP, where 
useful statistical diagnostics (such as monthly means, standard 
deviations, etc) or derived variables such as growing degree days could 
be computed. Other variables that were suggested as being useful were 
minimum and maximum temperatures, and vertically integrated moisture.</A>
<P>
The levels at which the variables 
would be saved were suggested as 250, 500, 700, 850 mb for the 
dynamical variables, as well as at the 10 m and 2 m levels in the 
surface layer. Precipitation and evaporation was suggested as being 
saved in mm every 6 hours, and snow depth in mm each day.</A>
<P>
The length of integration was 
decided as being two months but thought was given to a 3 month 
simulation with a 1 month spin up period for soil moisture.</font></A>

Discussions then centered on a 
timetable for finalizing a design for the first experiment - this was 
set as the end of January 1995. A workshop summary is to be sent to the 
participants by January 1, 1995.</A>

Funding sources were then 
discussed. Possibilities included NSF, the World Bank (which supports 
countries with specific projects), DOE, and with some possible seed 
money from IITAP. It was noted that with an emphasis on training 
developing countries' scientists (via IITAP) and providing them with 
useful tools (mesoscale models) that their countries can use, this 
project should generate a lot of interest. A possibility of having a 
future workshop sponsored by NATO was also suggested. </A>

Transcript of Federico Mayor's 
(Director-General UNESCO) remarks to the workshop. </A>
<P>
&quot;I would like to make three 
points, which for me are very important, .... the first point, speaking 
as a scientist, we talk often about applied science, I would insist 
that there is no applied science without science to apply. What I mean 
by this is that basic science is always extremely important, and that 
we must try to persuade the financial sources, the government, that 
basic science is extremely important. Because, again when I was 
minister of Education and Science in my own country I remember the 
Minister of Finance was always saying &quot;Yes, but applied 
research!&quot;, I was always repeating &quot;there is no applied 
science if there is no science to apply!&quot;. It was very important 
because sometimes we have this kind of disposition from the very 
beginning to apply but not to make fundamental research.&quot;</A>
<P>
&quot; ... the second point, this 
time as a politician, as a minister (that I have been) I know at what 
point it is important to have elements of scientific input in decisions 
today. There are many decisions which are based on economic and social 
parameters. We need more science, in such a way that it is feasible for 
the politicians to realize these elements. We need also to make an 
effort to present these elements in such a way so they understand and 
take into account the scientific input as one of the aspects of their 
decision. It is in this respect, I was telling Professor Vary, that it 
is our intention with UNEF and other agencies of the United Nations and 
NGO's and universities to start producing every three months a 
&quot;state of the planet report&quot;. Every three months, because now 
the reports are made every year, or every 2 years. And for politicians 
this is too long, they have more immediate problems, they need to have 
this kind of scientific input in their briefings.</A>
<P>
And also we have some problems 
today that should have more science at the municipal level, at the 
village level, for example, the utilization of fertilizers is very 
costly. We have no particular analyses of what kind of fertilizer we 
must utilize for any particular soil. No guidance to follow for 
recommended applications. We aren't getting the benefits from the 
fertilizer and polluting in the process.&quot;</A>
<P>
....&quot;the third point I would 
like to make, this time as Director General of UNESCO is ...... we have 
at this moment thirty thousand Ph.D.'s from south Sahelian Africa 
working in the most developed countries. Today they choose these 
countries in order to do their own research. It is for this reason that 
we are talking of having the possibility of doing the opposite; for 
professors and scientists from advanced countries to go to the south, 
not for many months, but for 2 or 3 months and to make a very rapid 
transfer of knowledge, in order that people can benefit on the spot and 
they also have a better feeling of sharing, because they realize that 
scientists from advanced countries are actually coming to their 
country. We create what they say, a unity between universities and 
central reserve systems with UNESCO's chairs. Here you have a tailor 
made design for work. The best scientists go there for 2 and 3 months, 
each one, then in 9 months you can have a very comprehensive transfer 
of knowledge&quot;.</A>
