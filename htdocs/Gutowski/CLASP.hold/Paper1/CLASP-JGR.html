</B><P>&#9;We present a model designed to study the coupled
land-atmosphere hydrologic cycle, following water from its inflow into
a region by horizontal, atmospheric transport through
surface-atmosphere exchange processes and aquifer recharge to outflow
as river discharge.  The model includes two-way water-flow among its
major reservoirs (atmosphere, soil, aquifer, river).  The model
emulates a gridbox of an atmospheric general circulation model, but
with finer horizontal resolution for the land processes, and forms a
testbed for developing continental-scale simulation of the hydrologic
cycle.  The model is calibrated using FIFE observations for 1987 and
validated using FIFE observations for 1988 and 1989.  Simulations with
and without aquifer coupling to the vegetation root zone demonstrate
the potential for horizontal water flow to affect area-averaged
evapotranspiration, through transfer of river water into adjacent
aquifers that can encroach the root zone in low-lying areas.  For the
case examined here, later summer evapotranspiration can increase by over
50% due to horizontal water flow.</P>

<P>1.  Introduction</P>
</B>
<P>&#9;Development of Earth-System models for the study of climate change requires a comprehensive understanding of the planet's hydrologic cycle.  Repercussions of potential climate change may be substantial for hydrologic processes occurring at the land-atmosphere interface, because water plays a central role in many economically important activities such as agriculture and transportation [e.g., Logaiciga et al., 1996].  Typically, the land surface has served as a boundary for quantitative studies focusing on either the land or atmospheric branches of the hydrologic cycle.  However, there are numerous potential feedbacks between land and atmosphere processes that require the interface to serve as a gateway between the two domains rather than a boundary.  Similarly, the bottom of the vegetation root zone has formed a boundary where water may flow out to subterranean aquifers, but often not from the aquifers into the root zone and eventually the atmosphere.   These couplings create potential feedbacks in the regional water cycle.</P>
<P>&#9;In order to study potential feedbacks between different water reservoirs, we have developed a Coupled Land-Atmosphere Simulation Program (CLASP) that models hydrologic processes extending from the atmosphere through the surface to aquifers and, ultimately, river systems.  In this paper, we describe the mathematical formulation of the model and present an initial application with realistic atmospheric forcing.  We use this application to assess effects on the regional water cycle of two-way couplings between the atmosphere-soil domain and the horizontal flow in the aquifer-river domain.</P>
<P>&#9;Atmospheric general circulation models (AGCMs) have historically had rather poor land surface parameterization schemes of terrestrial hydrologic processes [Avissar, 1992] despite the importance of water as a greenhouse gas [e.g.,Ramanathan1981, Logaiciga et al. 1996].  Three approaches have been taken in recent years to improve climatic simulation of the terrestrial hydrologic cycle:  (1) development of improved land-surface parameterization schemes for direct incorporation into AGCMs [e.g. Pitman 1988; Dickinson et al. 1993; Sellers 1996], (2) simulation of regional behavior using atmospheric mesoscale models to produce output that drives detailed surface hydrologic models [e.g., Hostetler and Giorgi 1993], and (3) simulation of basin-scale (e.g., 10 km x 10&nbsp;km) hydrology in scaling studies that aim at determining how to best represent the effects spatially varying surface properties in AGCMs [e.g., Famiglietti and Wood 1995].  The first approach has the advantage of allowing global-scale study of new parameterizations, but at relatively coarse (several degree by several degree) resolutions.  Details of watershed hydrology are neglected in this approach.  The last approach offers the finest resolution but does not couple to the scales typically resolved in an AGCM and may not include many, if any, of the feedbacks between surface and atmospheric processes.</P>
<P>&#9;This study embraces aspects of two of these approaches.  The CLASP emulates a single column of an AGCM, but with a spatially distributed representation of land surface processes.  Thus, like approach (1), we consider land-atmosphere feedbacks within an AGCM grid box, but like approach (3), we include basin-scale resolution of watershed hydrology.  In Section 2 of this paper, we present the rationale that has guided the development of the CLASP along the lines of these two approaches.  Section 3 gives a detailed description of the CLASP, broken down into its separate domains and the coupling between them.  In this section, we give the fundamental conservation laws governing the CLASP and their ancillary equations.   In Section 4, we use observations from the First ISLSCP Field Experiment (FIFE; Sellers et al., 1992) to calibrate and validate CLASP behavior.  In Section 5, we use the CLASP to demonstrate the effect of coupling horizontal water flow in rivers and subterranean aquifers to evapotranspiration averaged over a region.  A final section gives a summary and discussion of the results presented here.</P>

<B><P>2. Rationale</P>
</B>
<P>&#9;Several issues motivate the development of the CLASP.  At a fundamental level, global models are needed for the terrestrial branch of the hydrologic cycle to complement global models developed for the atmosphere and ocean.  A recent series of publications [Eagleson, 1986; Becker and Nemec, 1987; Shuttleworth, 1988; V&ouml;r&ouml;smarty et al., 1991; V&ouml;r&ouml;smarty et al., 1993; IGPB-BAHC, 1993] have outlined physical processes that must be represented in these terrestrial models, designated Macroscale Hydrologic Models (MHMs).  These models seek to simulate the gross features of continental-scale hydrology.  Linking MHMs to atmospheric general circulation models offers a potentially powerful tool for quantifying more completely terrestrial contributions to climate changes both in the past and in the future.  Linked models also offer the potential for accurate quantitative assessment of current water resources over the entire globe.  However, understanding the behavior of such macroscale systems poses a challenge, for by coupling individual watersheds to cover continental domains, one obtains a macroscale hydrologic system with feedbacks that may not be anticipated from the behavior of smaller units.  For example, how water flows through a watershed can affect surface evaporation and the net import or export of atmospheric water vapor, thus influencing the behavior of hydrologic processes in connected downwind or downstream landscapes.</P>
<P>   &#9;A key issue underlying MHMs is the range of spatial and temporal scales that may need to be included to properly simulate the macroscale system.  A large drainage basin is a mosaic of different land cover domains, each with characteristic water and energy dynamics.  The size of each domain may be as large as hundreds of kilometers across or as small as several meters (patch scale).  Many of the terrestrial processes in these domains such as runoff generation, surface water dynamics and water table fluctuations may have time scales ranging from days to months or longer.  However, the strong influence of plant transpiration on water fluxes at the surface can be characterized by time scales on the order of seconds to minutes [Committee on Global Change, 1990; IGBP-BAHC, 1993].  Further complexity may occur when MHMs are coupled with AGCMs.  Atmospheric dynamics relevant to the hydrologic cycle also encompass a wide distribution of scales ranging from turbulent dynamics in the lowest several hundred meters that occur on scales of seconds to hours to the slow evolution of global circulation patterns that occur over multiple years and decades.  These atmospheric spatial and temporal scales do not match many of the important scales for terrestrial hydrologic processes.  A land-atmosphere hydrologic model must be able to address such coupling across scales.</P>
<P>&#9;Ideally, a model would simulate directly all relevant hydrological processes across this wide spectrum of scales.  However, practical considerations of computing and data handling imply that some degree of model simplification is required that infringes minimally on the processes represented.  Indeed, one could argue that the ability to construct accurate, simplified models is a hallmark of our understanding of the hydrologic cycle.  From this perspective, one must then ask, what are the key hydrologic processes that must be included in a macro-scale model?  Because the simulation of the hydrologic cycle in all its detailed complexity is not practical, one would also like to identify a sufficient, physically based model and quantify as much as possible the inherent uncertainty bounds of its simulations.  For practical applications of MHMs, this uncertainty assessment is as important as the simulations' water-cycle output.</P>
<P>&#9;Coupled with the development of models such as the CLASP is a need for appropriate observational data sets.  These data sets are needed to (a) characterize terrestrial properties that serve as bottom boundary conditions to the model and (b) provide dynamic data for lateral boundary forcing.  Equally important, they provide the "ground truth" for quantifying the performance of a model simulation and the uncertainty of its output.  For all these reasons, we implement here a <I>data-rich</I>  approach advocated earlier [V&ouml;r&ouml;smarty et al., 1993] that gives the model the ability to incorporate data characterizing its parameters and boundary conditions at resolutions up to the highest available. </P>
<P>&#9;We have developed the CLASP to begin addressing the issues outlined above, especially for the purposes of coupling MHMs to AGCMs.  The CLASP is designed to emulate the hydrologic dynamics of one atmospheric grid box of a general circulation model.  Beyond the issues above, an ultimate motivation for the development of the CLASP is the aim of building a global model of the entire hydrologic cycle that includes water budgets and transports for land, atmosphere and ocean reservoirs.  The model presented here can be viewed as a first step in the process of constructing a complete, global model of the entire hydrologic cycle.</P>

<B><P>3. Mathematical Model</P>
</B>
<I><P>(a) Domains and Resolution</P>
</I><P>&#9;The Coupled Land-Atmosphere Simulation Program is a single atmospheric column coupled to an underlying terrestrial domain that may encompass one or more watershed catchments.  Earlier studies have also used similar one-dimensional (1D) atmospheric models to study land-atmosphere coupling [e.g., Wetzel and Chang 1988; Koster and Eagleson 1990] and ocean-atmosphere coupling [e.g., Gutowski et al., 1998] in the hydrologic cycle.  Because the CLASP emulates a gridbox of an AGCM, the atmospheric column's horizontal extent, and hence its horizontal resolution, can range from several tens to hundreds of kilometers, depending on the application.  The simulated atmospheric column extends from the surface to 19 km.  Vertical resolution of the atmosphere ranges from a few tens of meters near the surface to several hundred meters aloft, where less resolution is needed.  Higher resolution near the surface is used to resolve the atmosphere's planetary boundary layer (PBL).  The terrestrial domain consists of a vegetation, soil and groundwater system.  The terrestrial domain is divided into a number of regularly spaced cells that give the CLASP higher horizontal resolution at the surface than in the atmosphere, potentially allowing us to explore some of the scale-coupling issues described earlier.  A river network links the cells, with each cell containing one outflow stream.  In typical application, the CLASP uses tens to hundreds of terrestrial cells to resolve a watershed at scales down to a few kilometers.</P>
<P>&#9;A schematic view of the CLASP appears in <a
href="Fig.1.Schematic.GIF">Figure 1</a>.  The model consists of three
modules:  the atmospheric column model (ATMOS), a
soil-vegetation-atmosphere transfer model (SVAT) that computes the
exchange of water, energy, and momentum between the land surface and
the atmosphere, and a ground-water/surface-water model (GW/SW) that
simulates the flow of surplus water from the SVAT through the
subsurface to a river drainage network.  The modules are designed to
be plug-compatible [Kalnay et al., 1989].  They also are initial
representations of each domain.  The plug-compatibility will be
exploited to make future step-wise improvements in the model.</P> 
<P>&#9;To simulate the evolution of the terrestrial water cycle, the CLASP is run for periods of several months to years.  However, many important ATMOS and SVAT processes, such as cumulus convection and evapotranspiration respond to the diurnal cycle of solar radiation and, in addition, may operate on time scales as small as an hour or less.  The usual CLASP time step is thus 15 minutes.  Typical climate AGCMs also use a time step of about this magnitude to simulate properly the explicitly resolved atmospheric circulation, so the CLASP temporal discretization is consistent with its intent to emulate an AGCM grid box.  Groundwater flow could be simulated reasonably with much larger time steps (days to weeks), but using the same size time step for GW/SW processes incurs a relatively minor computational burden, results in minimal numerical dispersion, and simplifies analyzing the dynamics of the water budget of each module.  Time marching is accomplished using a discrete forward step that is computed by implicit finite difference methods, because of the diffusive terms in ATMOS [Press et al., 1992].</P>

<I><P>(b) ATMOS</P>
</I><P>&#9;The ATMOS portion of the model has been described in detail
elsewhere [Gutowski et al., 1998]; we give a brief description here.
Behavior of the atmospheric column is determined by conservation laws
for momentum, energy, mass, and water.  The governing equations are
the flux-form hydrostatic primitive equations [e.g., Lorenz, 1967],
with an added equation for water vapor conservation.  This is
essentially the same set used by AGCMs, but in a single column only.
Tendencies of prognostic variables due to horizontal convergences are
specified from a three-dimensional analysis of the atmosphere using a
relaxation method developed by D. Randall [personal communication,
1997].  Analysis fields are
usually available at most only every six or twelve hours.  The model
determines fiedls at intermediate times by linear interpolation in
time.  Like an AGCM, the model also includes parameterizations for
boundary-layer processes [Louis 1979; Louis et al. 1981], atmospheric
radiative transfer [Liou and Ou 1981, 1983; Liou and Zheng 1984],
cumulus convection [Emanuel 1991] and stable precipitation.
Parameterizations used to compute exchanges of moisture, heat and
momentum with the surface are discussed in the SVAT description.</P> 
<P>&#9;The model does not explicitly include a condensed-water conservation equation since the mass of water in the condensed phase is usually only a small portion of the total water mass in the atmosphere.  When condensed water does form, through supersaturation or cumulus convection, it immediately either falls from the atmosphere as precipitation or re-evaporates as it drops through drier air.  In this initial version of the CLASP, precipitation is distributed evenly over the surface.  Cloud cover is diagnosed for the purposes of radiative-transfer computations, using the parameterization of Slingo [1987], but since there is no condensed water budget equation, the mass of cloud water is not part of the water budget computations.  This approach for handling condensed water is common for AGCMs, though not universal [cf. Phillips, 1995].</P>

<I><P>(c)  SVAT</P>
</I><P>&#9;The CLASP's SVAT simulates the behavior of the soil zone
actively engaged in moisture, heat and momentum exchanges with the
atmosphere and in supplying water to aquifers and, ultimately, open
channels.  In this version of the CLASP, the zone is represented by a
single layer extending from the surface to the rooting depth of active
vegetation, topped by a canopy layer.  Any moisture draining from the
root zone is assumed to 
recharge the underlying aquifer.  This initial structure is relatively
simple, to facilitate understanding the coupling between the three
CLASP modules <a href="Fig.1.Schematic.GIF">(Fig. 1)</a>. For each
cell, we specify vegetation  type, soil type and texture, surface
roughness and surface albedo. 
Because these characteristics can vary from cell to cell across the
surface, the SVAT presents a potentially complex mosaic of surface
exchanges with ATMOS.  The impact of such surface spatial complexity
within a single atmospheric column is one direction of future
study.</P>

<P>When soil moisture exceeds the holding capacity of the active
layer, surplus water is treated as groundwater recharge to the

<P>The SVAT includes a canopy that intercepts precipitation,
re-evaporates it, and spills water to the surface.  In the formulation
used here, the canopy intercepts all precipitation, filling a canopy
reservoir distinct from the soil-moisture reservoir.  Water fills this
reservoir to its limit before it can overflow and spill to the ground.
Water evaporates from the canopy using (2) without Hdeep and with zero
canopy resistance.  No evapotranspiration from the soil/vegetation
occurs while there is water in the canopy reservoir. The depth of the
canopy reservoir is proportional to LAI and is determined as part of
the calibration.

<P>&#9;Finally, although the applications of CLASP later in this paper are for a region with generally small amounts of transient snow, the SVAT also includes the snow model of Dickinson et al. (1993) to accumulate and melt snow.

<I><P>(d)  GW/SW</P>

</B><P>&#9;Groundwater flow within each terrestrial grid cell accounts for net recharge from the SVAT, time-dependent subsurface flow toward the river (topographic minima), and water exchange between the aquifer and river network.  All water flows are potentially bi-directional.  The governing transmissivity-based equation for groundwater flow used in the GW/SW module is [Konikow and Bredehoeft, 1974]</P>

<P>&#9;<IMG SRC="Image11.gif" WIDTH=119 HEIGHT=29>&#9;,&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;(9)</P>
<P>where h is water-table elevation and other variables used in (9)
are defined in the Appendix.  The transmissivity, <IMG
SRC="Image12.gif" WIDTH=16 HEIGHT=18>, accounts for horizontal
variations in soil permeability and aquifer thickness.  Recharge
across each cell is assumed to be constant over a given time step.
Aquifer properties are permitted to vary from cell to cell depending
on the model domain's geology.  Equation (9) is intended to represent
shallow groundwater flow within a phreatic aquifer that is in good
hydrologic connection to a river.  While this formulation of
subsurface water dynamics is idealized, it is able to account for
spatial variability of aquifer hydraulic properties as well as capture
the gross features of water-table response to changing recharge
conditions.  These processes can not be represented easily by simpler
lumped-parameter formulations of aquifer hydrodynamics [Gelhar and
Wilson, 1974].</P>

</P>
<P>
In headwater cells, most of the flow is toward the river.  However, in
low-lying reaches, flow from the river into the aquifer can occur.  If
sufficient flow into the aquifer occurs, the top of the aquifer can
encroach into the vegetationUs root zone.  When this occurs, the water
is transferred from the aquifer to the soil moisture reservoir, and
the leaf-water stress coefficient, GLWP, is set to its no-stress
value, 1.  The aquifer potentially can become so deep that it floods
the surface.  In this case, computation of river depth to determine
downstream water flow includes the flood-water.

<B><P>4.  Calibration and Validation</P>
</B>
<I><P> (a) Observations</P>
</I><P>&#9;We use the set of FIFE observational data from the Konza Prairie Research National Area that was prepared by Betts and Ball [1998] for both calibration (1987 observations) and validation (1988 and 1989 observations).  Duan et al. [1996]<B> </B>conclude that FIFE observations in 1987 give a good depiction of the area&#146;s hydrologic cycle.  Betts and Ball [1998] express some caution, especially for 1988, when the observations do not close the area&#146;s water budget very well.  Although there is some forest in the region at lower elevations along rivers, the observations occur in grassland<B>.  </B>In this data set, all available FIFE observations of a field such as surface latent heat flux are averaged together at 30-minute intervals.  The averaging makes no distinction between instruments, nor does it use any differential weighting such as area-weighting.  </P>
<P>Betts and Ball also give the standard deviation of the reported values at each time step as well as the number of instruments contributing to the average.  For most days used, there are typically several instruments reporting values.  There are a number of reasons for the range of values among the measurements. Some are due to spatially varying cloud cover [Smith et al., 1992] and physical features of the landscape, such as a site&#146;s terrain-slope orientation [Nie et al., 1992a], specific vegetation characteristics (burned/unburned and grazed/ungrazed grassland)[Simth et al., 1992].  Instrumentation differences enter; surface latent heat flux measurements were made by both eddy-correlation and Bowen ratio instruments, giving slightly different results [Nie et al., 1992b] .  Finally, differences were also caused by measurement error [Kanemasu et al., 1992].  </P>
<P>We have used the standard deviation among concurrent measurements to give a metric for how accurately surface fluxes have been measured. Thus, our plots of FIFE observations versus time typically show two curves, the instrument average plus/minus the standard deviation.  We almost always apply a multi-day running average to flux figures to remove daily fluctuations and highlight climatological behavior.  In this instance, we apply the running average to the variance among concurrent measurements.</P>
<P>&#9;The primary calibration targets from the FIFE data set are elements of the hydrologic cycle:  surface latent heat flux, precipitation and cloud cover.  Surface sensible heat flux, near-surface temperature, heat flux into the ground and surface radiation were also included in model-observations comparisons, though they were not specifically targeted for calibration.</P>

<I><P> (b) Initial and boundary conditions</P>
</I><P>&#9;Consistent with our reference observations, we assume that
the CLASP is simulating a pure grassland in the central United States
at (39 N, 96.5 W) with leaf-area index, surface roughness, and surface
albedo given in <a href="Table_1.html">Table 1</a>.  The soil is assumed to
be a form of silty-clayey loam [NSSC, 1998; Famiglietti et al., 1992].
On this basis, 
we specify soil density, heat capacity and thermal diffusivity as
functions of soil moisture (<a href="Table_2.html">Table 2</a>) by
averaging values given by 
Garratt [1992] for in clay and sand.  We use linear interpolation
to specify these properties at soil moistures intermediate to those
given in Table 2.</P>
<P>Atmospheric forcing for these simulations is prescribed using
output from the operational forecast and data assimilation system for
the Nested Grid Model (NGM) of the U.S. National Centers for
Environmental Prediction (NCEP).  The NGM analyses give temperature,
wind and moisture fields every 50 mb (5</FONT><FONT FACE="Times"
SIZE=2>.</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">10</FONT><FONT FACE="Times"
SIZE=2>3</FONT><FONT FACE="Times"> Pa) in the lower atmosphere, which
is relatively high resolution compared to some other readily available
operational analyses of the atmosphere.  Since we are focusing on the
hydrologic cycle, higher resolution near the surface, where absolute
amounts of water vapor are largest, is desirable.  We use analysis
output from the four NGM gridpoints surrounding this location to
compute the horizontal boundary conditions for the model.  </P> 
<P>The NGM analysis gives the state of the atmosphere at 00, 06, 12,
and 18 UTC.  Although there are few upper-air observations available
at 06 and 18 UTC, we have found that using analyses for this times is
important for the water balance because the 06 UTC analysis will give
a depiction of the nocturnal low-level jet, a strong air flow from the
Gulf of Mexico into the central U.S. that is important for the
region&#146;s hydrologic cycle [Stensrud, 1996] </P> 
<P>&#9;We have also found that the atmospheric relative humidity in
the NGM analyses for this region tends to be low when compared to
atmospheric soundings at nearby sites 
<a href="Fig.3.TvsNGM.GIF">(Fig. 3) </a>.  
This deficiency
appears to be fairly constant throughout the year, with the
observations on average having 12% larger specific humidity.  As a
consequence, for the simulations here, we have increased NGM
atmospheric humidity by 12% on input, subject to the restriction that
input relative humidity does not exceed 100%.</P> 
<I>
<P> (c) Calibration</P>
</I>
<P>For the calibration simulations, we use NGM analyses from a
three-year period 1 January 1985 &#151; 31 December 1987 to drive the
CLASP.  In order to arrive at appropriate initial conditions, we cycle
through these three years repeatedly until soil moisture changes by
less than 1% from the start of one cycle to the next.  Aquifer water
evolves more 
slowly than soil moisture, but the focus of calibration is
surface-atmosphere coupling contained in the FIFE observations.  To
simplify this stage of the computation, we allow water to spill from
the soil to the aquifer but do not permit any aquifer enchroachment
into the root zone and ignore the fate of water once it enters the
aquifer.  This assumption appears reasonable for the FIFE
observations, which have very few valley bottom sites [Smith et al.,
1992] and not likely to receive significant soil moisture
replenishment from river-aquifer coupling to the root zone.  </P> 
<P>The years 1985 &#151; 1987 do not show any extreme climatic
behavior in atmospheric driving data, so we assume that the state to
which the model evolves during spin-up is a representative initial
condition.  Prior to spin-up, initial coarse calibration was performed
through a sequence of 80-day sensitivity simulations spanning 1 July
&#151; 8 September 1987.  The model was then spun-up to create an
initial state assumed to apply to 1 January 1985.  Final calibration
was performed by running the model from 1 January 1985 through 31
December 1987, using the spun-up state as initial condition for soil
and atmospheric water.</P> 
<P>Four aspects of model construction emerged as important calibration
factors:  effective relative humidity to initiate stable (large-scale)
condensation, effective length of the growing season, amount of
available soil water, and cloud cover parameterization.  </P> 

<P>(c.1) Precipitation</P>
<P>To initiate condensation, the model&#146;s original treatment was
to allow water condensation when relative humidity exceeded 100% at
the end of a time step.  This resulted in deficient precipitation.
Many models (<B>find examples [AMIP?] or modify this statement</B>)<B>
</B>use a simple assumption that the effective saturation relative
humidity, RH<SUB>eff</SUB> , is less than 100% .  The reasoning is
that spatial variability in humidity may cause parts of a layer in a
gridbox to become saturated even when gridbox-average relative
humidity is less than 100%.  However, using RH<SUB>eff </SUB> &lt;
100% essentially a correction for bias in the model.  The relatively
coarse grid of the driving analysis (165 km x 165 km) compared to the
FIFE domain (approximately 15 km x 15 km) may be one source of bias
because atmospheric convergence will be smoothed somewhat on the
coarser grid, resulting in less intense moisture convergence.  In
addition, atmospheric mass convergence will be less intense, resulting
in weaker vertical motion and thus less vertical moisture
advection.</P> 
<P>Some additional adjustment was made to the convection scheme, where
the fraction of precipitation falling outside the convective cloud,
CP, may be adjusted (Emanuel, private communication).  The parameter
CP was reduced to one sixth its original value.  This also yeilded an
small increase in precipitation.  In addition, this adjustment
retained an approximately even split between stratiform and oonvective
precipitation.  While real world precipitation is obviously much more
complex than a simple split between two types of precipitation, this
partitioning is similar to typical behavior of mesoscale models over
the U.S. (e.g., Pan et al. [1998]).  Adopted values for
RH<SUB>eff</SUB> and CP appear in <a href="Table_3.html">Table 3</a>.
</P> 
<P>(c.2) cloud cover</P>
<P>The primary adjustment of the cloud cover parameterization was to
adjust the dependence of stratiform cloud cover on relative humidity
to be consistent with the onset of stratiform precipitation.  Thus,
stratiform cloud cover is 100% when relative humidity =
RH<SUB>eff</SUB>.  </P> 

<P>(c.3) Available soil moisture</P>
<P>The model&#146;s original prescription for grassland rooting depth
(RD) was 1.25 m, with the maximum available water capacity equal to
13% of RD, or 0.162 m.  For the period 28 May &#151; 15 October 1987,
when both evapotranspiration E and precipitation P measurements were
made, the amount of water lost from the soil was at least (E-P) =
0.185&nbsp;m, so the original water capacity of the soil was too small
versus observations.  We adjusted both the rooting depth and maximum
available water fraction (AWF) to help give adequate surface latent
heat flux.  Final values of these parameters appear in <a href="Table_3.html">Table 3</a>.
<P>(c.4) Effective growing season</P>
<P>&#9;One of the conductance coefficients in (4),
G<SUB>leaf</SUB>,  depends on the near-surface air temperature:
</P>
<P>
<img src="Image21.gif" width=321 height=102> , (15)
</P>
<p>  
where originally T<sub>oo</sub> = 0.  We have used this function to
control green-up and senescence in the model.  In the original
G<SUB>leaf </SUB> formula, substantial evapotranspiration could occur
in spring as temperatures warmed above freezing.  Although FIFE
surface evapotranspiration observations in 1987 begin only on
<B>DATE</B>, model behavior suggested that simulated E was too large
in spring, resulting in a soil moisture deficit and weak
evaportanspiration later in the summer.  We delayed the onset of
substantial evapotranspiration in the model by shifting the G<SUB>leaf
</SUB> formula toward higher temperatures.  Final values were chosen
to give adequate surface latent heat flux in mid-summer and appear in
 <a href="Table_3.html">Table 3</a>.
</p>
<P>(c.5)  Canopy reservoir</P>
<P>
The canopy reservoir depth is proportional to LAI.  We set the
reservoir depth to (0.1 mm 4 LAI).  The depth/LAI ratio was calibrated
to be between two extremes:  having a relatively deep reservoir that
allows too little water to reach the ground and having a canopy
reservoir of negligible depth and, hence, negligible influence.   For
ratios of 0.1 mm/LAI and smaller, approximately 85% of water from
modest to intense storms (precipitation > 10 mm/day) fell through to
the surface, consistent with results reported in Dingman (1994),
though here the vegetation is prairie grass.  Larger ratios yielded
much less fall through.  The adopted ratio is also the same as used by
<B>Bonan (19__)</B> in his detailed SVAT. 
</P>
<P>(c.6) Calibrated model</P>
<P>Comparisons of the calibrated model versus FIFE observations appear
in Figures 4 - 10 and <a href="Table_4.html">Table 4</a>.
Surface latent heat flux 
from FIFE observations and the calibrated CLASP appear in
 <a href="Fig.4.GIF">Fig. 4</a>.
  The CLASP time evolution falls approximately in the middle of the
two FIFE curves and thus reproduces surface latent heat flux during
the 1987 period of observations quite well.  The bias and temporal
standard deviation between the CLASP and FIFE observations (after
31-day running average) are relatively small.  </P> 
<P>&#9;The comparison of observed and simulated precipitation (<a
href="Fig.5.GIF">Fig. 5</a>) 
shows daily values and thus does not use a running average to smooth
time series curves, in order to distinguish frequency of occurrence
from daily magnitude.  Note that figure shows observed precipitation
multiplied by &#151;1 to separate the two curves.  The model
reproduces the frequency of rainfall events fairly well.  Although the
model tends to produce more precipitation on the days with greater
observed precipitation, it does not reproduce the most intense daily
values.  This is not surprising, as the analysis providing the
model&#146;s boundary conditions has a grid spacing (~ 165 km)
that is much coarser than the roughly 15&nbsp;km width and breadth of
the FIFE observation domain.  As a consequence the external forcing of
precipitation events will be spatially smoothed, and thus somewhat
muted, compared to that experienced by the actual atmosphere in the
FIFE domain.   The bias in CLASP precipitation rate versus FIFE
observations is relatively small.  The temporal standard deviation
between the two is somewhat larger, although smaller than the temporal
standard deviation (8.2 mm/d) of the daily observations versus no
precipitation. </P> 
<P>&#9;Daily cloud cover fluctuates rapidly in the observations and
the model (<a href="Fig.6.GIF">Fig. 6</a>), the model generally matching the
observations well over most of the period.  We do not subject the
cloud-cover time series to a running average because of a data gap
from day 239  to 257 that considerably reduces the time span allowing
averaging.</P> 
<P>&#9;Other simulated surface energy fluxes (sensible heat, incident
solar radiation, downward infrared radiation, heat into the soil)
generally compare well will observations. Surface sensible heat flux
has acceptable values during the observing period ( <a
href="Fig.7.Fsh.GIF">Fig. 7</a>) 
with small bias and standard deviation versus observations (<a
href="Table_4.html">Table 4</a>), although it does not capture a slow,
monthly variability seen 
in the observations.    Incident solar radiation at the surface agrees
well with FIFE observations ( <a href="Fig.8.IncSol.GIF">Fig. 8</a>)
except at the end of the 
year, when it is larger.  For both the observations and the
simulation, the envelope of daily values (not shown) gradually
declines toward the end of the year, and the model&#146;s envelope is
nearly coincident with the observation&#146;s.  However, over the last
30 days of the year, the simulated daily values tend to lie closer to
the envelope than do the observations.  This indicates that the
model's cloud cover is deficient during this period.  The FIFE
cloud cover data set unfortunately terminates before this point,
preventing a cloud-cover comparison.  The simulated infrared radiation
from the atmosphere to the surface also compares well with FIFE
observations ( <a href="Fig.9.IRdown.GIF">Fig. 9</a>).  The deleted
from the comparison are the last 30 days of the year, when
observations become sporadic.  Finally, the model's simulation of
energy flux into the 
soil ( <a href="Fig.10.SoilHF.GIF">Fig. 10</a> ) agrees well with the
FIFE observations except at the end of the 
observation period, when the model simulates more energy leaving the
soil than given by the observations.</P> 
<P>&#9;</P>
<I><P>(d)</I> <I>Validation</I></P>
<P>&#9;For CLASP validation, we continued the run of the fully
calibrated model through 1988 and 1989.  The next set of figures were
constructed in the same manner as the calibrations figures:  FIFE
observations are presented as the instrument average given by Betts
and Ball (1998) plus or minus the standard deviation of the instrument
average.  In addition, Tables <a href="Table_5a.html">5a </a> and <a href="Table_5b.html">5b</a> give biases and standard
deviations of CLASP output from FIFE observations for the periods that
the observations are available. </P> 
<P>&#9;For surface latent heat flux ( <a href="Fig.11.FlhVal.GIF">Fig.
11</a>), CLASP values are 
relatively low compared to FIFE observations in 1988 but are close to
FIFE observations in 1989.  Betts and Ball (1998) note that FIFE
observations for the region's water budget do not balance.  The
imbalance is worse for 1988 than 1987.  In addition, even though the
FIFE region experienced drought in 1988, the 1988 surface latent heat
flux observations are close in magnitude to the 1987 observations.
These features of the observation suggest some caution in using them
to assess model.   Nonetheless, the FIFE data represents a consensus
of measurements by instruments in the field, and the model is
deficient versus these observations in 1988.  However, any deficiency
in the 1988 simulation is not permanent, as the model reproduces the
1989 simulations well.</P> 
<P>&#9;Precipitation simulation for 1988 and 1989 ( <a
href="Fig.12.PcPVal.GIF"> Fig. 12 </a>) 
reproduces features of the 1987 FIFE-CLASP comparison:  the model
tends to capture the frequency of wet and dry periods well, but has
more difficulty matching the observed magnitude, especially for
intense rain events.  CLASP bias versus FIFE is acceptable in 1988 (<a href="Table_5a.html">Table 5a</a>).,
but is rather large in 1989 (<a href="Table_5b.html">Table 5b</a>).
Much of the bias in 1989 is due to very intense precipitation events
that the model does not capture.  The model's inability to
capture this relatively extreme event further underscores the
difficulty of reproducing observed precipitation for a relatively
small area compared to the resolution of the driving fields.</P> 
<P>
Cloud cover observations were not available from the Betts and
Ball (1998) dataset for 1988 and 1989.  Surface fluxes of incident
solar radiation (<a href="Fig.13.IncSol.GIF">Fig. 13</a>) indicate
that the model produces 
reasonably good cloud cover with bias toward less cloud cover than
actually occurred in 1988.  Other energy fluxes at the surface
(sensible heat flux, downward infrared radiation, heat flux into the
soil) compare acceptably well (Figs. <a
href="Fig.14.FshVal.GIF">14</a>,<a href="Fig.15.IRdown.GIF">15</a>, <a href="Fig.16.SoilHF.GIF">16</a>),
except that the CLASP
sensible heat flux tends to be too large in 1988, consistent with its
latent heat flux tending to be too small.  As with the latent heat
flux, the surface sensible heat flux returns to values similar to the
FIFE observations in 1989.</P> 
<P>Overall, CLASP does a reasonably good job of simulating climatic behavior of water and energy cycles for the two-year validation period when judged against FIFE observations.  Two years after the calibration period, there do not appear to be any persistent trends in the model that cause permanent bias versus observations.  Indeed, the model&#146;s surface sensible and latent heat fluxes appear to recover well in 1989 from whatever bias they had in 1988.</P>


<b><FONT FACE="Times"><P>5.  Demonstration Simulation:  Horizontal
Coupling of the Land-Atmosphere Water Cycle through River Flow</P>
</b></b>
<I><P>(a) Model configuration and boundary conditions</P>
</I><P>&#9;We present here a demonstration of model utility for
examining issues of coupled land-atmosphere water cycles, by
performing a suite of simulations to study effects of horizontal
river-water flow on the region&#146;s hydrologic cycle.  For these
simulations, we again locate CLASP over the FIFE site and tile the
surface of an 80 km x 80 km simulation domain with 1600 cells that
resolve the region&#146;s surface topography and river network at 2 km
resolution (<B>FIG</B>).  River widths were specified in an
idealized manner according to the elevation of the cell (
<B>FIG ##</B>), with river segments being widest in lowest lying areas.
Although this region in reality receives upstream river discharge from
the Kansas River, here we ignore any such boundary input in order to
focus on the effects of horizontal redistribution of river flow
generated within the simulation domain.  In order to focus on the
effects of redistribution of the water by the river network, we again
assume the domain&#146;s vegetation is purely grass and do not include
forested areas that appear in the region, particularly in some of the
river valleys.</P> 
<P>&#9;Some of the simulation performed here includes two-way coupling
between root-zone soil moisture, the subterranean aquifer and river
water, so additional preliminary simulation was necessary to spin-up
the aquifer.  In order to arrive at appropriate initial conditions, we
again cycle through the years 1985-1987 repeatedly until the most
slowly evolving water reservoir, the subterranean aquifer, changes by
less than 2% in water amount from the start of one cycle to
the next.  During this cycle, the change in the aquiferUs water
storage, dVa-r/dt (Fig. 1), was a factor of 10 smaller than
time-average runoff generation.   Further simulations from the spun-up state span the
period 1 January 1985 &#151; 31 December 1993, using NGM analyses for
atmospheric boundary conditions.</P> 
<P>&#9;Results are given here for two principal simulations:  one in which encroachment of aquifer water into the root zone is allowed and one in which it is not.  For the former, water entering the river network potentially can re-enter the aquifer reservoir downstream and even return to the vegetation root zone if there is sufficient river head.  Water draining from upstream root zones can thus become available again for evapotranspiration through horizontal redistribution in the river network.  The simulation period includes episodes of  drought, flood and otherwise average hydrologic behavior, allowing us to examine the influence of horizontal redistribution under a variety of conditions.  This study is a preliminary investigation of the impact of such redistribution on the region&#146;s water cycle, using the relatively simple SVAT and GWSW modules of the initial CLASP.</P>
<P> </P>
<I><P>(b) Results</P>
</I><P>&#9;<a href="Fig.16c.Runoff.GIF">Figure ## </a> shows the time
evolution of net runoff from the subterranean aquifers for the
simulations with and without groundwater encroachment.  Net runoff
here is the water flowing from the aquifers into the river network in
some cells minus water flowing from the river network into the
aquifers in others.  For the simulation with no encroachment, there is
a substantial increase in runoff during winter in most years, which is
a response to aquifers recharging when evapotranspiration is small.
Four winters (1987-88 through 1990-91) show no increase because winter
precipitation is relatively low compared to the other winters and
because the model&#146;s 1988 drought depletes soil moisture so much
that the soil reservoir can not increase sufficiently in winter to
generate aquifer recharge.  During this period, the no encroachment
runoff displays persistent draining of the aquifers with an
approximately exponential decay.</P> 
<P>&#9;When encroachment is included, net runoff displays more rapid
evolution with a substantial decrease going from winter to summer.
This occurs because water flowing into the aquifers can now enter the
soil root zone and subsequently evaporate or transpire into the
atmosphere.  Although water can enter the root zone any time of the
year, the effect on net runoff is greatest in summer when
evapotranspiration is strongest.  In winter, when evapotranspiration
tends to vanish, net runoff is approximately the same in either
simulation because there is no substantial loss of water from the
aquifers through the root zone to the atmosphere.  Thus the runoff
evolution in the simulation with encroachment has the gradual runoff
decay seen in the no-encroachment, but with a superimposed annual
cycle variation.</P> 
<P>&#9;As suggested by net runoff, evapotranspiration differences
between the two simulations (<a href="Fig.16c.Flh.GIF">Fig. ##</a>)
are largest in summer. 
In nearly all years, encroachment yields a late-summer increase in the
domain's evapotranspiration (surface latent heat flux).  At the
same time, surface sensible heat flux decreases by about the same
amount, so that the net energy loss from the surface by these two
fluxes remains about the same, whether or not encroachment is
included. Changes in the ratio of latent to sensible heat flux (Bowen
ratio) could potentially alter atmospheric processes such as deep
convection, but no systematic change in precipitation occurred between
these two simulations.  </P> 
<P>Differences evapotranspiration are smallest in the years 1992 and
1993, which were marked by relatively large amounts of rain in the
simulations (not shown) and, of course, by flood conditions in the
real world.  The effect of encroachment should be smallest in wet
years because the soil will already be very wet over the domain.
Thus, evapotranspiration will not be inhibited by a soil-water stress
that aquifer water can alleviate through encroachment.  The
differences are largest during the drought year (1988), when
encroachment yields a 15-20% increase in running-average
evapotranspiration over most of the summer, with the increase
exceeding 50% at times.  For 1988, horizontal transport of water by
the river network provides water at lower elevations to the aquifers
and root zones, allowing additional evapotranspiration and thus
altering the land-atmosphere hydrologic cycle.</P> 
<P>&#9;The year 1989 is also relatively dry, as indicated by Fig.
<B>##-ET fig.</B>, but encroachment has relatively small effect.  The
continued drainage of the aquifer (Fig. <B>##-runoff</B>) by runoff
reduces the amount of water that can flow back to the root zone at
lower elevations and be available for evapotranspiration.  For part of
1989, evapotranspiration in the simulation with encroachment is
actually smaller than in the simulation without encroachment.  Similar
behavior at smaller magnitude occurs in other years as well.  The
reason for the reduced evapotranspiration is presently not
understood.</P> 
<B>
<P>6. Discussion</P>
</B>
<P>&#9;We have presented a model designed to study the coupled
land-atmosphere hydrologic cycle, following water through a wide
spectrum of transformations from its inflow into a region by
horizontal, atmospheric transport through surface-atmosphere exchange
processes and aquifer recharge to outflow as river discharge.  The
model is intended to help improve our capability to simulate the
global-scale hydrologic cycle and so is designed to emulate a gridbox
of an atmospheric general circulation model.  Land processes, however,
are simulated at finer resolution.  The model thus forms a testbed for
developing continental-scale simulation of the land-atmosphere
hydrologic cycle.  Because the model aims at assisting our
understanding of macro-scale hydrologic processes in climate
simulation, its component parts in this initial formulation are
relatively simple to aid interpretation of model behavior.  However,
because the model is designed to be a testbed for hydrologic
simulation, it has also been designed to allow relatively
straightforward implementation of alternative numerical models of
component processes.</P> 
<p>
Simulations with
and without aquifer coupling to the vegetation root zone demonstrate
the potential for horizontal water flow to affect area-averaged
evapotranspiration, through transfer of river water into adjacent
aquifers that can encroach the root zone in low-lying areas.  For the
case examined here, later summer evapotranspiration can increase by over
50% due to horizontal water flow.</P>
