<P><b> 1.  INTRODUCTION</b></P>
<P>
<P>&#9;Many human activities could benefit from forecasts of
temperature and precipitation patterns several months into the future,
as detailed studies have shown (e.g., Georgakakos et al. 1998).
Agriculture and water 
resources management, in particular, could use such information to
great advantage.  Day-to-day weather forecasts months in advance are
not possible.  However, there is ample reason to believe that one
could forecast changes in statistical characteristics of the weather
such as time-average temperature and precipitation variability, i.e.,
forecast climate.  For example, many weather characteristics are
strongly influenced by changes in the earth&#146;s climate system that
evolve much more slowly than weather events, such as the annual cycle
of insolation and the variability of ocean temperature.</P> 
<P>Links between slowly evolving features that govern climate and
day-to-day weather variability are gradually becoming understood.
Recent advances in numerical modeling of the land-atmosphere-ocean
system on a number of fronts indicate that numerical, earth-system
models are becoming more adept at simulating these links (GCIP 1998).
Physically based global models have been used for some time to explore
the potential for season climate prediction (Palmer and Anderson
1994).  The time is ripe for testing and improving the capability of
physically based models to forecast changes in seasonal climate
several months into the future.</P> 
<P>&#9;Seasonal climate forecasts are most useful if they can resolve
trends for different domains of human activity, such as agricultural
zones or watersheds.  One important advance in recent years is the
development of regional, numerical climate models (Giorgi and Mearns
1991; McGregor 1997) that use fundamental conservation laws of mass,
energy and momentum to simulate the evolution of the earth-system.
These models typically have resolutions of approximately 60 km or 1/2
degree of latitude, enabling them to resolve at least major climatic
domains and river basins.  The models provide an important link
between global- and regional-scale climate processes.  They can
&quot;downscale&quot; global forecasts of seasonal and interannual
variability to regional scales.  At the same time, they can integrate
regional energy and water fluxes into a coupled, physically consistent
depiction of continental hydroclimate.</P> 
<P>&#9;Daily weather forecasts have been shown to be more useful if
end-users have an estimate of forecast reliability (Wilks and Hamill
1995).  End-users 
typically must make risk assessments that balance the costs of
responding or not responding to a forecast, so estimates of forecast
reliability can help them hedge their response.  Seasonal climate
forecasts are also more likely to be useful if the end-user has an
estimate of their reliability.  Advances in computing hardware have
allowed the introduction of operational, ensemble weather forecasting
for periods out to 10 days (Toth and Kalnay 1993).  Further advances
are creating the potential to perform ensembles of seasonal forecasts
from which one can produce estimates of likely ranges in climate
variables such as precipitation.  Exploratory studies using global
models have been promising (Livezey et al.  1996).</P> 
<P>&#9;Taking advantage of these research advances could greatly help
the economy of southern Africa.  To do so will require a concerted,
cooperative effort of research and graduate-level training in the
areas of climate study, computer science and statistics, which we
propose here.   A potential outcome of this effort is that benefits of
seasonal forecasting will encourage countries across the region to
develop infrastructure supporting operational seasonal climate
forecasting.  Development of such an infrastructure would advance a
closely related goal of this effort, to provide African students
trained in this program the opportunity to exercise their talents on
climate problems germane to their home regions while residing in their
home countries.  Furthermore, these students will receive training in
the fundamental physics and mathematics of seasonal climate
forecasting, so that although their efforts may be focused on
forecasting issues for southern Africa, they will have opportunity to
contribute to fundamental science on the global level.</P> 
<p>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>2.  REGIONAL CLIMATE MODELING</P>
</B>
<P>&#9;Regional climate modeling based on fundamental conservation
laws has emerged from the development of so-called atmospheric
mesoscale models (Anthes 1990), which simulate atmospheric circulation and its
coupling with the underlying surface with resolutions on the order of
10&#146;s of km.  Advances in regional climate modeling have led to
the development of major international programs involving multiple
versions of these models to advance further the state of the science
[e.g., GEWEX Continental International Project (GCIP 1998), MERCURE
(Jones et al. 1998), <a href="http://www.pircs.iastate.edu">Project to
Intercompare  
Regional Climate Simulations</a> (Takle 1995; Gutowski et al. 1998), among
others].  Concurrent with the 
modeling development has been the assembly of multi-decade, global
databases that provide initial conditions,boundary conditions, and standards
for verification of forecasts.  The atmospheric reanalysis projects
producing these data bases have involved major, international
forecasting and research centers [U.S. National Centers for
Environmental Prediction (Kalnay et al. 1996), European Centre for
Medium Range Weather Forecasts (Gibson et al. 1997), U.S. NASA Goddard
Space Flight Center (Schubert et al. 1993)].  Additional global
databases are also being generated that can provide verification data
at mesoscale (1/2 degree) and higher resolution (e.g., <a
href="http://edcwww.cr.usgs.gov/landdaac"> USGS 1998</a>).</P>  

<P>(a) <U>Basic Research</P>
</U><P>&#9;One or more mesoscale models will be tools for understanding and improving ability to simulate interactions between regional (mesoscale) circulation and water and energy cycles that govern regional climate.  Mesoscale models will be used to examine the relative contributions of factors that influence precipitation over southern Africa, such as</P>
<ul>
<li> eddy rings in the Agulhas current off the southern tip of Africa
and other sea-surface temperature variability </li>
<li> persistent elevated inversions over the continent</li>
<li> tropical-extratropical interaction</li>
<li> wind-driven coastal upwelling</li>
<li> moisture sources and transport</li>
<li> regional soil moisture anomalies</li>
<li> orography</li>
<li> vegetation feedbacks to regional circulation</li>
<li> land-use change</li>
</ul>

<P>Related to this work will be research examining relative influences
on hydroclimate of local factors (e.g. soil moisture) and remote
factors such as sea-surface temperature anomalies.  The latter will
enter through their modification of general circulation and, as a
consequence, lateral boundary conditions for the mesoscale model.  A
possible initial simulation/analysis project would be simulating the
January/February 1996 wet period in South Africa, using a domain <a
href="Figure1.html">(Fig. 1)</a> that covers southern Africa at 60-km
resolution and driving 
boundary conditions from the NCEP/NCAR or ECMWF reanalysis.   On a
modest-level workstation (e.g. Dec Alpha 3000), such a simulation
requires approximately 4 cpu days per simulated month.  Recent
experience (Arritt, personal communication) suggest that even faster
simulation can occur using a fairly common Pentium II (233 MHz)
processor running UNIX.  Analysis of model output would focus on the ability of the model to capture the extreme event and, assuming favorable comparison, on the model's dynamics that contributed to the event.  Interest would focus in part on determining if there is important mesoscale behavior that coarser-grid global models miss, such as topographically controlled precipitation or details of tropical-extratropical interaction. </P>
<P>Mesoscale models will be used to explore coupling to further elements of the water cycle beyond soil-vegetation-atmosphere interaction, such as subterranean water flow and surface water flow and impoundment.  In related activity, mesoscale models will be used to explore simulation at finer scale through grid nesting at high (order 1 km) resolution for selected regions where validation data is available.  The nested modeling will thus aim at resolving water basins of modest size.  This activity will provide a basis for linking continental simulation directly to operational water management.  Related research will also explore interactions linking fluctuations in water table, lake/wetlands evaporation and regional precipitation.  This activity will aim toward developing the capability to simulate the water cycle from net atmospheric input to freshwater flow into the ocean, thus advancing understanding of the complete, continental water cycle.</P>
<P>Supporting research will include evaluation of mesoscale-model simulation in the presence of particularly challenging features of southern African geography such as very strong topographic gradients and sharp climatic boundaries (Hewitson, personal communication).  Supporting research will also provide testbeds for refined parameterization of land-atmosphere coupling and precipitation modeling.  One outcome of research in these areas will be the knowledge base for eventual, effective global model simulation at mesoscale resolution.</P>

<P>(b) <U>Operational forecasting</P>
</U><P>&#9;One ultimate goal of this effort is operational forecasting
of seasonal climate several months in advance.  Initially, mesoscale
models will be used to provide experimental forecasts at 30 km or
higher resolution, using boundary conditions provided by global,
coarse-resolution seasonal forecasts produced experimentally at major
forecasting centers.  These forecasts will include estimates of
forecast skill by giving, for example, probability distributions of
forecast fields.  Special emphasis will be given to output products
that have utility in applied sectors such as water resource management
and agriculture.  Forecasts with demonstrated economic value may
provide compelling motivation for a nation (or multi-national
consortium) to engage in operational seasonal forecasting for southern
Africa using physically based modeling.  It is anticipated that
refinement in global seasonal and 
interannual forecasting as well in mesoscale land-atmosphere modeling
could allow such forecasting to become routine by the end of the next
decade.</P> 
<p>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>3. COMPUTER SCIENCE</P>
</B>
<P>The evolution of a climate forecast can be sensitive to small
changes in external factors such as specified boundary conditions.
These conditions are not known perfectly.  Knowing how the error
statistics of the boundary or other external conditions affect the
forecast gives an estimate of forecast reliability.  Advances in
computing hardware are creating the potential to perform ensembles of
seasonal forecasts where one can use such error statistics to generate
multiple realizations of boundary conditions to drive an ensemble of
model forecasts.  Such ensembles can sample potential future states of
the climate and produce likelihood estimates of possible ranges in
climate variables such as precipitation.</P> 
<P>&#9;Some of the advance is due to developments in computer
hardware.  High performance computing has evolved from expensive
mainframes (e.g., Cray) to integrated parallel systems (e.g., nCUBE,
Intel Paragon) to massively parallel computation clusters using
low-cost commodity processors (e.g., Intel Pentium) and public-domain
operating systems.  The evolution toward this computing paradigm has
provided compelling economic arguments to pursue it vigorously (<a
href="Table1.html">Table 1</a>; Gustafson, personal communication).
The opportunity exists for countries in southern Africa to develop
relatively inexpensive clusters that can be built incrementally using
common, desktop personal computers.</P> 
<P>&#9;There are of course other costs involved with using commodity
clusters:  software development can be cumbersome and processor
coordination for massively parallel computation is complex.  However,
a substantial body of experience has been developed at Iowa State
University in the Scalable Computing Laboratory (SCL) headed by John
Gustafson.  The SCL has provided collaborative assistance to ISU
groups in a number of disciplines.  The SCL has also assembled a
<A href="http://www.scl.ameslab.gov/Projects/ClusterCookbook">
"cookbook"</a> for constructing these systems, and they are 
considered leaders in this field.  Their expertise could provide the
means to use parallel computing effectively.  Transferring this
expertise to Africa would provide a major opportunity to train African
computer scientists in cutting-edge computing that could be developed
and applied in their home countries.</P> 
<P> &#9;Even with the experience of the SCL, adapting a major,
regional climate simulation code to a massively parallel machine can
pose a daunting programming job, one that has often required years of
effort by teams of highly skilled programmers.  In addition, code
upgrading is discouraged because it could require starting from
scratch to re-parallelize the code.  Prof. Suresh Kothari at Iowa
State has developed an important solution to this problem by
recognizing that an expert system focusing on specific classes of
computation can simplify the programming demands considerably.
Kothari&#146;s Parallelization Agent (PA) has yielded in a few weeks
parallel codes that had required months and years for manual
parallelization.  Not only does the PA allow rapid parallelization of
an original code and further modifications, but because it rewrites
the code, the chance of errors due to typos, misplace lines, etc. is
minimized.  Coupling of PA and SCL expertise could allow substantial
computing resource development for climate modeling in southern Africa
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>4.  STATISTICS</P>
</B>
<P>&#9;Supporting research for the regional climate-forecasting
program will engage statisticians.  Their expertise will be used to
explore a variety of approaches for producing probabilistic
forecasts. Ensemble daily weather forecasting has received substantial
attention (e.g., Houtekamer 1995; Houtekamer and Derome 1995), but
statistical expertise is generally needed only 
for producing ensembles of initial conditions.  Seasonal ensemble
forecasting needs additional attention to developing ensembles of
boundary conditions with physically consistent and appropriate
statistical properties.  Activities of statisticians will include
various forms of ensemble simulation, such as specification of initial
and boundary conditions, and approaches combining numerical simulation
with statistical modeling.  Statistical analysis should also include a
side-by-side comparison of the ensemble simulations with output from
purely statistical approaches to producing regional climate from
coarse-grid global simulation.  Finally, statistical expertise will be
needed for the very important tasks of model diagnosis and forecast
evaluation.</P> 
<p>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>5.  EDUCATION AND INFRASTRUCTURE</P>
</B>
<P>&#9;A climate-forecasting project could provide several opportunities for educating new scientists and giving advanced training to current scientists in southern Africa.  Each of the activities proposed above should entail training of next-generation scientists within Africa. </P>
<P>&#9;A central facility supporting education and related research could provide a regional focus for computational resources, modeling expertise and technical support.  However, financial considerations probably preclude developing such a facility.  A more appropriate model might be a &quot;virtual&quot; facility wherein a national or multi-national program is spread across a cluster of institutions that maintain strong links for computing, data archiving and educational resources. Such a facility might also provide a means of melding in institutions in adjacent countries through a systematic program of expansion.</P>
<p>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>6.  FINAL COMMENTS</P>
</B>
<P>&#9;A significant base of activity exists in the Republic of South Africa that could provide a strong foundation for the program proposed here.  The Systems Modelling Group at the Universities of Cape Town and the Witwatersrand, headed by Prof. Bruce Hewitson, links together several faculty using leading models for climate simulation.  The South African Weather Bureau (SAWB) is experienced with operational seasonal forecasting already, using empirically based statistical approaches.  The SAWB also has extensive experience in shorter term forecasting (up to 10 days) with mesoscale models.  Prof. Peter Tyson (Univ. Wits.) is head of the International Geosphere-Biosphere Project (IGBP) START program for Africa.  Prof. Mark Jury (Univ. Zululand) is head of the World Climate Research Programme&#146;s CLIVAR/Africa steering committee.  Strong statistical experience in geophysical issues exists at the University of Witwatersrand; strong experience in seasonal hydrology issues exists at the University of Natal.  This list is undoubtedly incomplete, but gives some indication of the existing foundation in South Africa. </P>
<P>Additional social aspects influencing the proposed activity must also be noted.  An important activity in South Africa is the effort to increase involvement of black South Africans in research and operations.  Currently, talented students are often lured to well-paying careers in the private sector.  While this economic advancement is hardly a problem in itself, it does pose special challenges to identifying and retaining students qualified to become high-level scientists.  Linked to this issue is the need to develop supporting infrastructure in all the countries of southern Africa.  Such development is critical for the ultimate success of this program.  An infrastructure that allows students trained in this program to work profitably in their home countries will help stem the drain of talented scientists to more developed countries and allow seasonal forecasting for the region to advance.  The economic benefits of seasonal forecasting should be used to encourage countries across the region to develop this infrastructure.</P>
