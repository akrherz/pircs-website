<font class="text">Participation in PIRCS is open to all modeling groups 
willing to 
perform the simulations and furnish the output in a standard format.  
PIRCS supplies boundary conditions for the atmosphere as well as
sea surface temperatures and an initial soil moisture field.
In order to perform a controlled experiment
all participants must use these data for initial and boundary
conditions (with interpolation to your model's horizontal and
vertical grid).  Please see the <a href="http://www.pircs.iastate.edu">PIRCS
home page</a> for links to additional information on the
boundary conditions and output archive.
<P>
It is very important for all project participants to adhere as closely
as possible to the specifications for the output archive.  Departures
from the specified format may lead to delays in processing your
results.  Since our resources for analyzing the data are
limited, we reserve the right not to process results that
depart substantially from the archive specifications.
<P>
All project participants are responsible for securing their own
computer time and other resources for running the simulations.
Computational resources needed for PIRCS
Experiment 1 can be estimated assuming
two 60-day simulations of roughly the continental
United States at mesoscale resolution (approximately 
100 by 70 horizontal grid points at 60 km spacing). 
Although we cannot provide direct support to participants,
the PIRCS coordinators at Iowa State University will entertain
requests for endorsements or letters of support for computing requests
or funding proposals.
<P>
PIRCS participants meet approximately twice per year, usually in 
conjunction with a professional meeting (such as AMS or AGU), 
to report progress, discuss problems of mutual interest, 
and plan for jointly authored publications.
Reports of past meetings and announcements of upcoming
meetings are linked from the 
<A HREF="http://www.pircs.iastate.edu">PIRCS home page</A>. 
PIRCS does not supply 
funding for participants' travel.
