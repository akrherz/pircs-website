<H1><CENTER>Precipitation Error by Region in PIRCS-Ib</CENTER></H1>
The contribution of mean error, amplitude error, and position error is
examined by scale for subregions of the U.S. The U.S. is subdivided into
three regions of 18 lon x 24 lat degrees, referred to as the western,
central and eastern regions. The western region is dominated by precipitation
processes associated with synoptic to microscale slope flow. Over half of
central precipitation is from organized convective systems that tend to
develop overnight.  I'm not sure how to characterize eastern precipitation.
Scaling and error analysis are performed in the same manner as for the
entire U.S. domain

The least MSE is found in the western region. Each of the three MSE terms
are smallest there. Position errors are greatest for the central region,
where a distinct region of maximum precipitation was located, indicating
the most difficult task is predicting the location of this maximum. Mean
error is similar for eastern and central regions, suggesting the models
have trouble extracting the correct amount of water from the atmosphere
in these regions. The relatively large composite amplitude error in the
eastern region indicates the models have difficulty reproducing spatially
concentrated rainfall. It should be noted that central region MSE
exceeds MSE for the U.S. domain.
