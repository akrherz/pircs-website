<H1><CENTER>Precipitation Forecasts from Different Starting Times</CENTER></H1>
The plots below contain gridded observations and forecasts of precipitation accumulated between midnight 1 July 1993 and midnight 2 July 1993.  The same data (NCEP-DOE Reanalysis-II) were used to generate conditions at the forecast start time and the boundary conditions supplied to the model.  The start time was varied such that each forecast was begun a day earlier.  Thus, the forecast start times are June 30 7pm CDT (1-day forecast), June 29 7pm CDT (2-day forecast), June 28 7pm CDT (3-day forecast), June 27 7pm CDT (4-day forecast), and so on.
