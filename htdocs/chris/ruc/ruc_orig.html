<H1><CENTER>RUC precipitation</CENTER></H1>
Here is the precipitation from the RUC integration for the PIRCS-1B period (June 1- July 31, 1993).  The two images below this paragraph are the 60-day accumulation of precipitation for an observed data set and for the RUC output, respectively.  In the RUC output, similar to other PIRCS models, the maximum precipitation is shifted northward of the observed.  This region is situated north of the surface front, where we would expect LLJs to contribute to mesoscale ascent.  The RUC model differs from others in that it predicts very few LLJs.  The implications of fewer LLJs are discussed in a paragraph below.

Because LLJs are fewer in the RUC output, the northward water vapor transport is much less than in other PIRCS models.  The images below show the time- averaged northward transport for one version of MM5 and the RUC, respectively.

A second difference is found in the timing of precipitation.  Below are plots of the daily cycle for the mean precipitation.  The observed cycle has a distinct nocturnal maximum, while the RUC has an afternoon maximum.  Other models showed similar behavior, even models that predicted a high frequency of LLJs.  So, the challenge isn't just predicting LLJs, it is also predicting the correct coupling of LLJs and precipitation.
