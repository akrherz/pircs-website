<P>
Here is the time-averaged (60 days) 900 mb v-component from the RUC and six RCMs that participated in PIRCS1a and PIRCS1b. 
</P>
<P>
The wind field is computed by exactly the same method for each of the RCMs.  The wind component is interpolated vertically by a log-linear function.  Grid points for which 900 mb lies below the surface are flagged as missing.  Horizontal interpolation onto a standard half degree lat-lon grid is accomplished by a variant of the Barnes scheme, although I haven't masked the terrain that is above 900 mb the wind values at those grid points are not included in the horizontal interpolation.

<P>
What I notice is that the RUC wind fields are smoother and contain smaller local maxima.  This is also true for the <a href="http://www.pircs.iastate.edu/chris/ruc/ruc_u.html">u-component</a>.  And, this is consistent with previous diagnostics of the vertically integrated meridional moisture flux in <a href="http://www.pircs.iastate.edu/chris/ruc/ruc_orig.html">ruc_orig.html</a> and <a href="http://www.pircs.iastate.edu/chris/ruc/ruc.html">ruc.html</a>.  It looks like to me that the problem is in the wind field, in particular the low-level wind field, since the 500 mb geostrophic height field is not that abnormal (bias is less than 1% of the actual and not any larger than any of the other RCMs).
