<h3><center>PIRCS Experiment 1(c)</center></h3>
<p>
PIRCS 1C forcing boundary conditions are now available for the PIRCS
community.  This simulation is planned to be a multi-year case
covering much of North America.  The data format is the same as PIRCS
1B, with integers in ASCII.  The main difference from PIRCS 1A and 1B,
in addition to length of simulation, is the southward extension of the
domain by 5 degrees latitude, as agreed upon at the <a href="../CPH/
index.html">PIRCS Copenhagen meeting</a>, May 2000.
