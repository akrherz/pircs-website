<h3>1.  INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE</h3>

        The Project to Intercompare Regional Climate Simulations (PIRCS) is a
community-based program whose mission is to advance the status of
regional climate modeling by evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of
limited-area models and their component procedures through systematic,
comparative simulations.  PIRCS has several goals within this mission,
among them:
<ul>
*       To establish credibility of climate simulation using mesoscale
	models<P>

*       To complement GCIP/G-NEP<p>

*       To create benchmark for assessing performance of limited-area models<P>

*       To be relatively easy to perform
</ul>

 PIRCS was organized under the auspices of the International Institute
of Theoretical and Applied Physics (IITAP), a joint venture of UNESCO
and Iowa State University.  As part of its mission, IITAP aims at
fostering excellence in scientific research and teaching in developing
geographical areas.  PIRCS organizers feel that mesoscale models offer
opportunities for scientists in these areas to address applied problems
of their home country while also contributing to basic, world-class
research.  The inter-comparison also offers opportunities for creating
and expanding partnerships between scientists in different countries.<p>

<h3>2. EXPERIMENT 1</h3>

        An initial planning workshop was held 17-18 November 1994, which
coincided with the formal launching of IITAP.  Thirty-five scientists
from Europe, Canada and the U.S. attended and helped formulate a
mission, scientific objectives, and design of the initial
intercomparison experiment.<p>

The location of the initial experiment was chosen to be the central
United States (Fig. 1).  Several factors motivated this choice in
addition to the goals listed above.  The central U.S. is a region with
substantial available data for model validation and it has a strong
mesoscale climate feature, the nocturnal low-level jet.  In addition,
in keeping with the aims of IITAP, it is also an agriculturally
important region with significant water-cycle variability.<p>

        Experiment 1 consists of two 60-day simulation periods:<br>
<ul>
(a) 15 May - 13 July 1988<P>

(b) 1 June - 30 July 1993                                           
</ul>

Each period is characterized by a strong climatic signal:  the drought
of 1988 and the U.S. Midwest flooding of 1993.  These periods thus
provide clear climatic signals for the models to simulate.  Exp.  1(a)
emphasizes  thermal   and  dynamical processes and is intended to
provide an initial comparison of how well regional models represent
aggregate characteristics of weather events in a simulation long enough
to include many such events (i.e., to simulate regional climate) during
a period when surface thermal forcing within the domain is large and
precipitation and latent-heat effects are minimal.  Exp. 1(b)
emphasizes processes of the water cycle and will examine
strengths and weaknesses of parameterizations of precipitation.  A
major focus in each case is on how surface forcing within the models
contributes or even dominates the resulting regional climate.<p>

the "forcing frame" for external boundary conditions.<P>

Simulations will be constrained in a "forcing frame" at the lateral
boundaries (Fig. 1) by 6-hr data from NCEP reanalyses for 1988 and
1993.  PIRCS will provide the necessary NCEP data .  In addition, PIRCS
will provide initial soil-moisture and periodic ocean and lake surface
temperatures.  For simplicity, each modeling group is encouraged to use
their model's topography and land characterization procedures already
established for this region, if they exist.  The PIRCS support staff,
however, will provide a reference topography and land-characterization
dataset for participants needing this information.  The choice of
physical parameterizations such as cumulus convection and radiation is
left to each modeling group.<P>

<h3>3. DIAGNOSIS</h3>

        PIRCS will maintain a data archive for comparative diagnosis of model
behavior.  Like the first experiment, the archival dataset for model
output is designed to be relatively simple to promote participation of
modeling groups and to minimize data exchange errors.  Three types of
data will be included in the archive:

<ul>
(a) Hourly
	<ul>
        surface energy and moisture fluxes<br>

        top-of-atmosphere energy fluxes<br>

        surface pressure<br>

        precipitable water<br>

        mixed-layer depth<br>

        horizontal wind at 500 m above ground<br>

        "rawinsonde" profiles at select locations<p>
	</ul>
(b) Daily
	<ul>
        maximum termperature at 1.5 m<br>

        minimum temperature at 1.5 m<br>
                                    
	soil moisture<p>
	</ul>

(c) Averages over consecutive 5-day periods
	<ul>
        Variables:  Temperature, specific humidity,

                horizontal winds, geopotential height<br>

        Levels:  1000, 925, 850, 700, 500, 400,

             300, 200 mb<br>
	</ul>
</ul>

        The archive will be used, for example, for diagnosis and validation of
the moisture budget, the energy budget, precipitation and daily
temperature extremes.  In addition, PIRCS will perform and encourage
supplementary simulations that alter conditions, such as domain size,
initial soil moisture and data set used for external forcing.<P>

 PIRCS will work with other international numerical modeling programs
including COMPARE, GEWEX  [specifically the GEWEX Numerical
Experimentation Panel (GNEP) and GCIP], AMIP, and PILPS and with the
WGNE to ensure coordination with related experiments.<p>

<h3>4.  PLANS</h3>

        The PIRCS planning group has released a beta-test data set.  This is a
prototype set of initial and boundary conditions for a 5-day period
that is being used to test simulation and archiving procedures.  It
will also provide interested parties a means of assessing the resources
needed to participate.  After refining procedures based on feedback
from beta-test participants, we will release the full, 60-day dataset
for experiment 1(a).<p>
