The discussions following the Kyoto Protocol have emphasized the need to
understand better the potential regional impacts of global climate change.
Impacts on agriculture, water resources, human health, and ecosystems are
tied to climate change over regions (provinces, counties or states) rather
than to changes in broad continental or global averages.  It is therefore
imperative to understand and, ideally, to predict how global climate change
is manifested at these regional scales.<P>

The horizontal resolution of present-day numerical general circulation
models (GCMs) is too coarse to provide satisfactory depictions of regional
climate change.  Studies of regional climate-change impacts thus require
methodologies to translate GCM output to smaller scales.  Using the GCM
output to drive limited-area atmospheric simulations of climate change on
regional scales is a promising but relatively new approach and research is
actively underway to assess its merits.  In response to a challenge from
the Working Group on Numerical Experimentation (WGNE) of the World Climate
Research Programme (WCRP), we are coordinating a community-based project to
examine the validity of the regional climate modelling approach and to
assess its added value relative to GCM predictions.<P>

An international team of nine modeling groups from North America, Europe
and Australia is conducting the first stage of this research, in which
sub-seasonal (60 day) simulations are being performed for two extreme
events in the central United States.  Preliminary results indicate
strengths and weaknesses common to these regional models as well as
occasional substantial differences between models.  The second stage is
being performed using three of these regional models to simulate 10 years
of climate for the central United States.  These simulations are being run
with three sets of lateral boundary conditions:<p>
<ul>

<li>First, climate of the recent past (1979-1988, included within the AMIP
period) is being simulated using NCEP/NCAR reanalysis output to provide the
same initial and boundary conditions for all three of the regional models.
These results can be compared directly to observed data in order to
establish the models' skill at replicating regional climate and its
variability.  Using three distinct regional models gives a preliminary
indication of the robustness of regional climate projections.<P>

<li>Second, these three models will perform 10-year simulations of regional
climate for the same location but with initial and boundary conditions
supplied from Hadley Centre GCM simulations of present climate.  By
comparing these results with the preceding simulations and with
observations we can identify biases that are attributable to driving the
regional models with large-scale information from this GCM rather than from
observations.<p>

<li>The third set of simulations will be identical to the second except that
initial and boundary data will be taken from Hadley Centre output for
future climate perturbed by increased greenhouse gases and by aerosol
effects (around the year 2050).  Comparison of these results with the
preceding two sets allows us to interpret the projected regional climate
change in light of the errors induced both by the regional models and by
the use of the GCM-supplied initial and boundary conditions.<P>
</ul>

We are coordinating our efforts with statistical downscaling research and
other regional climate modeling projects such as the European Community
MERCURE project.  Output from these simulations will be prepared for use by
impacts analysts for the Third Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change.<p>
