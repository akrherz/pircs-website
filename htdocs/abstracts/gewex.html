<h3>ABSTRACT </h3>

 PIRCS is a community-based project, organized under the auspices of
the International Institute of Theoretical and Applied Physics (IITAP) at
Iowa State University, to intercompare regional models run in climate mode.
PIRCS will consist of a series of collaborative intercomparison experiments
using different mesoscale models to simulate the climate of the Central US
for a 60-day period beginning 15 May during the drought year of 1988 (Exp.
1a) and a follow-on 60-day experiment for the Midwest flood period
beginning 1 June 1993 (Exp. 1b).  Exp. 1a emphasizes thermal and dynamical
processes and is intended to provide an initial comparison of how well
regional models represent aggregate characteristics of weather events in a
simulation long enough to include many such events (i.e., to simulate
regional climate) during a period when surface thermal forcing within the
domain is large and precipitation and latent-heat effects are minimal.
Exp. 1b emphasizes processes of the water cycle and will examine strengths
and weaknesses of parameterizations of precipitation.  Simulations will be
constrained at the lateral boundaries (roughly just beyond the continental
US) by 6-hr data from the new NMC re-analysis for 1988 and 1993, and the
major focus of attention will be on how surface forcing within the models
contributes or even dominates the resulting regional climate.  Model
simulations will be performed by the participating research groups at their
own expense;  the research herein proposed focuses on the intercomparison
of these simulations.  PIRCS will provide the management of datasets, 
including initialization, boundary conditions, and simulated results, using
procedures and protocols consistent with other large intercomparison
projects and will work with other international numerical modeling programs
including COMPARE, GEWEX  [specifically the GEWEX Numerical Experimentation
Panel (GNEP) and GCIP], AMIP, and PILPS and with the WGNE to ensure
coordination with related experiments.  A presentation on PIRCS was made to
the WGNE at its October 1995 meeting in Reading, England, where PIRCS
received strong encouragement to continue.  More information on PIRCS can
be found on the Internet at http://www.physics.iastate.edu/atmos/pircs.html.
