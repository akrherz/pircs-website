The Project to Intercompare Regional Climate Simulations (PIRCS) is a
systematic exploration of strengths and weaknesses of climate
simulation by atmospheric mesoscale models.  Participating models are
simulating climate for the Central US during a 60-day period beginning
15 May 1988 (drought year) and a follow-on 60-day period beginning 1
June 1993 (flood year).  These are periods and a region that the GEWEX
Numerical Experimentation Panel has targeted for simulation by
regional-scale models.  Targeted physical processes include the Great
Plains nocturnal, low-level jet and other mesoscale influences on the
region's water cycle.<P>

        We are directing the PIRCS effort, including developing boundary
conditions, collecting and maintaining standard output from
participating modeling groups, and assembling relevant observations for
evaluating the simulations.  As a demonstration of features of PIRCS
simulations, we present preliminary results of our own simulations
using a version of RegCM2.  We compare simulation output with
observations and demonstrate mesoscale features of the simulations that
can be discerned in the PIRCS standard archive.  The comparison will
also illustrate some of the observational records that are available
through the PIRCS Web site (<a
href="http://www.pircs.iastate.edu">http://www.pircs.iastate.edu</a>) for modelers
to use in evaluating their own simulations.   <P>
