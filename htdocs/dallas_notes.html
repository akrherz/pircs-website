    <p><font class="text">The meeting was preceded by a buffet dinner 
courtesy 
of
    EPRI. Gutowski thanked attendees for their participation and
    Hakkarinen for making arrangements. Attendees introduced
    themselves and the agenda was briefly viewed.</font>
    
    <p><font class="subhead">Review</font>
    <p><font class="text">The group reviewed various past and upcoming 
meetings
    relevant to PIRCS:
    <ul><font class="text">
        <li>Gutowski first visited the WGNE in 1995 and discussed
            the planning for PIRCS. Andrew Staniforth then served
            as WGNE liaison to PIRCS until his move to the UK Met
            Office in 1998. Gutowski and Arritt met with WGNE in
            November 1998. While some on the WGNE expressed
            skepticism regarding the general validity of nested
            regional climate models (RCMs), the meeting provided
            valuable feedback to PIRCS and prompted some on the
            WGNE to educate themselves about regional modeling.
            The WGNE is interested in testing basic aspects such
            as whether an external signal can be propagated
            through the RCM domain, and whether the RCMs recover
            large scale features of the driving GCM or analysis
            (as advocated by R Jones). Other concerns are the
            appropriate domain size and location for RCM
            integration, as well as implications of the lack of
            conservation at the RCM boundary for energy and water
            balances. The WGNE members were very interested in
            the Dickinson simulations which compare a RCM to a
            set of CCM3 simulations differing in their horizontal
            resolution (including uniform high resolution). Some
            at the WGNE meeting (such as Phil Merilees) pointed
            out importance of specific atmospheric phenomena.
            Fox-Rabinovitz noted that the WGNE&#146;s concerns
            are legitimate and must be addressed. Kim noted that
            depending on domain size and forcing, the regional
            model can drift into its own climatology and can to
            some extent correct large scale features if dependent
            on terrain, etc. Paegle mentioned that this depends
            on the specific field and that analyses differ for
            divergent part of the field. Gutowski pointed out
            that the large scale behavior to be reproduced has to
            be behavior that the analysis captures well. Pielke
            raised concerns about the mismatch of scales at the
            RCM boundaries.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Gutowski attended the CLIVAR in Paris during early
            December 1998. The CLIVAR Science Plan promotes
            evaluation of downscaling to provide useful
            information for ultimate users and projections of
            extreme events. They have expressed a desire to
            promote evaluation of regional models driven by
            reanalyses along with comparison to comparable
            simulations driven by GCMs and comparison of regional
            climate models with statistical downscaling.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>The PIRCS team continues to maintain contact with the
            European Union MERCURE program. Jens Hesselbjerg
            Christensen is a participant in both MERCURE and
            PIRCS.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Arritt is co-convenor (with Filippo Giorgi) of a
            session on regional modeling at the IUGG meeting to
            be held July 1999 in Birmingham, England. He
            encouraged the group to attend and present their
            results.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Filippo Giorgi is conducting a colloquium on
            &quot;The Physics of Climate Change: A Regional
            Perspective&quot;, to be held in Trieste, Italy, 7-25
            June1999. The colloquium is divided into 3 parts: a
            conference on Global Climate Change (7-8 June); a
            conference on &quot;Detection and Modeling of
            Regional Climate Change&quot; (9-12 June); and a
            training workshop on &quot;Theory and Modeling of
            Regional Climate Change&quot; (14-25 June). The
            second of these is of most direct relevance for
            PIRCS.</li>
    </ul></font>
    <p><font class="subhead">NCAR CSM Runs</font>
    <p><font class="text">Hakkarinen provided background on recently 
completed 
runs
    of the NCAR CSM on a NEC SX-4 in Japan. Wigley then gave an
    extended description of these runs, which were completed in
    December 1998. The CSM was run at horizontal resolution T42.
    The period 1870 to about 2000 was run at NCAR and then the
    period 1980-2100 was run in Japan for two scenarios:
    business-as-usual, and CO<sub>2</sub> stabilization around
    550 ppm. The runs included direct sulfate forcing only, which
    corresponds to radiative forcing of about &#150;0.6 W m<sup>-2</sup>.
    It is planned that a future run will include solar
    variability. The ocean was initialized to representative SSTs
    for the late 19th century. The SO<sub>2</sub> emissions are
    very different from IS92a and most previous scenarios in that
    emissions reduce by about 60 percent by 2075. </p>
    <p><font class="text">Two 20-year data records were saved at 6-hourly 
intervals
    for driving regional models. It will be at least another
    month before the runs have been sufficiently evaluated to
    release. Pielke noted possible consequences of the fact that
    the CSM runs don&#146;t include land use changes.</font>
    
    <p><font class="subhead">Overview of PIRCS 1b (1993
    flood)</font>
    <p><font class="text">The group discussed diagnostics for PIRCS 1b. 
The ISU
    group has constructed a 0.5 degree precipitation analysis
    from NCDC data and compared this to predicted precipitation
    for 1993 for several models. All models reproduced the
    precipitation maximum over the north-central US and did not
    have the spurious precipitation maximum in the southeastern
    US that appears in the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis. (Hong mentioned
    that this was corrected in Reanalysis-2 with the new
    convection and PBL schemes adopted in 1995.) Magnitudes of predicted
    precipitation maxima corresponded reasonably well to
    observations. A presentation in the GCIP meeting earlier that
    evening noted that 12-24 hour precipitation forecasted in the
    ECMWF reanalysis gives error of 10-20%, to which absolute
    errors of PIRCS models compare favorably.</font>
    <p><font class="text">The question of
    &quot;value added&quot; by mesoscale simulations was raised.
    It was suggested that we look at the intense rainfall events
    in comparison with time history of rainfall over the Upper
    Mississippi River area to see if models again are able to
    capture individual events. The stationary front over
    the central US was important for the flood and may represent
    value added for mesoscale models. We also should check if the
    nocturnal precipitation max shows up in 1993. Roads suggested
    that since the LLJ was stronger in 1993 the nocturnal maximum
    may be better captured. Lawford asked what is the added value
    for the surface data and can we understand the process. Hong
    suggested we look at individual heavy precipitation events,
    e.g. 7 July 1993. Roads recommended comparison to daily
    gridded precipitation.</font>
    <p><font class="subhead">Publications</font>
    <p><font class="text">Reviewers of the JGR paper on the Experiment 1a 
results
    say there needs to be more analysis. Analysis of the 1988
    case is hindered somewhat by the lack of profiler
    observations. We need to explain common problems and
    collective biases among the models. There is a European model
    comparison report that provides an example of ways to do
    analysis. A specific addition to the analysis is cumulative
    precipitation maps compared to the 0.5 degree precipitation
    analysis produced by the ISU group. Presently the comparison
    focuses too much on the large scale flow. Gutowski suggested
    diagnosis of mesoscale circulation for the precipitation
    episode on Day 160 in 1988, which apparently was an organized
    mesoscale system. Another diagnostic is predicted
    precipitation in the southwest US monsoon for 1988. While all
    models show an indication of monsoon onset, some give
    unrealistically large precipitation. </font>
    <p><font class="text">There was discussion
    regarding a follow-up paper on Experiment 1b. It was
    suggested that we look at the intense rainfall events in
    comparison with time history of rainfall over the Upper
    Mississippi River area to see if models again are able to
    capture individual events. Kim mentioned that the
    models can produce most events in western U.S. where
    precipitation is anchored to the terrain. There was
    discussion as to whether models can be expected to reproduce
    specific events. Katzfey suggested we look at whether
    mesoscale processes generally can be produced, not
    necessarily specific events. We have profiler data available
    for 1993 for evaluating the predicted wind field, especially
    the low-level jet.</font>
    
    <p><font class="subhead">Results from a stretched grid 
    model</font>
    <p><font class="text">Michael Fox-Rabinovitz showed results for 
several
    simulations of the 1988 case. These included both a uniform
    resolution GCM and a stretched grid model driven with
    observed SSTs. Output was also shown for data assimilation
    with data withdrawn over target area as an
    &quot;imitation&quot; of the nested grid approach. This
    method shows very good results. There was general agreement
    that PIRCS should include variable-resolution models.</font>
    
    <p><font class="subhead">Future activities</font>
    <p><font class="text">Roads mentioned that Rick Lawford is asking for
    observations for a climatology of the Mississippi River
    basin. PIRCS may be able to contribute evaporation simulations or
    energy budget information.
    <p>The group briefly discussed some sensitivity 
experiments.
    Results were shown from grid extension experiments for the
    1993 flood, done at ISU by Zaitao Pan. Extending the domain
    to the south or east produced a similar or slightly improved
    precipitation field compared with the standard PIRCS domain
    while extending the domain to the west produced worse
    results. Arritt mentioned that extending the domain westward
    pushes the inflow boundary into a data-poor region (the
    Pacific Ocean). Hong showed simulations comparable to Seth
    and Giorgi (1988, J. Climate) which gave different results
    for soil moisture sensitivity. Notably, Hong found there
    always was positive feedback from soil moisture to
    precipitation amount.
    <p>Possible follow-up experiments were briefly discussed. Among the 
ideas presented were a
    multi-year simulation using the present domain; repeating the
    runs for 1988 and 1993 at higher resolution; and
    intercomparison for the Amazon region for comparison with
    forthcoming LBA results. It was agreed that PIRCS
    should develop closer affiliation with AMIP. </p>
    <p class="text">The next meeting of
    PIRCS modelers is not likely before Fall AGU. Hakkarinen
    encouraged planning for a next meeting. A paper describing
    1993 results should be prepared by Fall AGU, preferably
    sooner. Continuing to publish results is important for
    modelers to justify participation in PIRCS.</font><p>
