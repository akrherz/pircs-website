Limited-area atmospheric numerical models have recently gained widespread 
use as tools for understanding regional climates.  This technique is also 
being explored as a method for evaluating regional climate change and its 
impacts on human activities.  This session will summarize recent progress 
and outstanding issues in the use of regional climate models.  For this 
purpose "climate" simulations are defined as having duration of at least 
30 days (i.e., beyond the range of deterministic weather prediction). 
Contributions are also invited on complementary modeling techniques, 
such as global variable-resolution models, and methods for processing 
and interpreting regional climate model results.
<P>
The regional climate modeling session is a part of a four-day
program on model intercomparisons, which
will also include AMIP and other organized climate
model intercomparison projects.
Presently this model comparison program is scheduled 
for 19-22 July, during the
first week of the IUGG assembly.  The regional modeling session
is tentatively scheduled for <B>Wednesday, 21 July 1999.</B>
More information on the four-day model intercomparison series
is available at the
<A HREF="http://www-pcmdi.llnl.gov/conf/IUGG98_MC01/IUGG99.html">PCMDI web site.</A>
<P>
The abstract deadline
for IUGG99 has been extended to <B>19 January 1999</B>.
Instructions for abstract submission and 
information on the IUGG XXII General Assembly can be found at
the
<A HREF="http://www.bham.ac.uk/IUGG99/">web site for 
IUGG99</A>.<P>
Presenters at the IUGG99 session are encouraged to submit followup
papers to a JGR special issue on regional climate modeling, which
will have a manuscript due date in the fall of 1999.
Contributions to the JGR issue also
are welcome from those who are unable to attend
the IUGG session.

<H3>Abstract Submittal</H3>
<P>
Abstracts can be submitted by online web form, email,
or postal mail.   All abstracts must be submitted directly to the IUGG.  It
will be helpful to send a copy to the co-convenors, but <I>this does not
replace the requirement for submission to the IUGG.</I>
<P>
1.  <B>Online</B> submission can be done through the web form at the main IUGG web
site:
<A HREF="http://www.bham.ac.uk/IUGG99/abform.htm">
http://www.bham.ac.uk/IUGG99/abform.htm</A>
<P>
Under the heading "Association and Symposia" click IAMAS and then in the
drop-down window choose MC01 - Improvements and intercomparisons of climate
system models.
<P>
2.  <B>Email</B> your abstract to the IUGG following the instructions given on
their web page:
<A HREF="http://www.bham.ac.uk/IUGG99/abstract.htm">
http://www.bham.ac.uk/IUGG99/abstract.htm</A>
<P>
Note that the abstract must be sent as plain ASCII text, not an attached
file.  If you prepare your abstract using word processing software, copy
and paste the material into your email program so that it is sent as plain
text. 
<P>
In the supplementary information following your abstract, for item 1
(session number) use MC01 and for item 2 (session name) use "Improvements
and intercomparisons of climate system models."
<P>
3.  <B>Postal mail</B> instructions are essentially the same as for email
submission given above.  For details see the IUGG web page at:
